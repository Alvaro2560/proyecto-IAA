( wraps financial - creditquality - moodys and financial - defaults - s & p ) by jonathan stempel new york , oct 29 ( reuters ) - corporate credit quality will likely grow much worse before it gets better , and about $ 100 billion of corporate debt will likely go into default this year as the united states heads into recession , according to reports issued on monday by two top credit rating agencies . moody ' s investors service said it put ratings on review for downgrade for 122 u . s . companies with $ 543 billion of debt in the third quarter , dwarfing the 22 companies with $ 66 billion of debt it put on review for upgrade . reviews are a leading indicator of the direction of corporate credit .  a wide excess of rating reviews for downgrade over upgrades in the third quarter suggests credit deterioration will persist at least into early next year ,  said john puchalla , moody ' s senior economist . meanwhile , standard & poor ' s said more than 200 companies will default on about $ 100 billion of debt this year , compared with 117 defaulting on a record $ 42 . 3 billion in 2000 . it said the default rate for junk bonds - those rated  bb - plus  or lower by s & p and  bal  or lower by moody ' s because of their credit risks - will reach 9 . 4 percent by year end . moody ' s forecasts a 10 percent rate .  the u . s . economy is clearly in a recession ,  said s & p chief economist david wyss in a statement .  although standard & poor ' s expects it to be relatively mild and end in early 2002 , the risk of a longer and deeper downturn is high .  both agencies said the sept . 11 attacks contributed to a deepening of a three - year slump in corporate credit quality . moody ' s blamed 38 reviews for downgrade in september alone on the attacks . costs rise , protection weakens u . s . corporate credit quality is falling for many reasons . these include the weakening economy , the inability of many marginal companies to raise cash at tolerable interest rates , share buybacks , debt - financed merger activity , and fallout from the attacks on such industries as airlines , insurance and travel .  many companies in financial difficulties will see their funding sources dry up and be pushed over the brink ,  said david keisman , managing director at s & p risk solutions . even well - known companies are suffering rating declines . on monday alone , for example , s & p downgraded mcdonald corp . after the world ' s largest fast - food chain said it will buy back up to $ 5 billion of stock , at a time s & p said the company ' s  growth prospects for the future are less optimistic .  meanwhile , moody ' s downgraded enron corp . , and warned it may downgrade it again . the energy trading giant is struggling with vanishing investor confidence , reflected in a share price that has plunged by more than half in two weeks , as it tries to keep access to cash it needs to run its business . puchalla said the credit quality decline could slow next year , in part because interest rates are low and companies are managing their balance sheets more conservatively .  lower borrowing costs and slowing debt growth should reduce debt servicing costs , and fiscal stimulus from the federal government should boost business revenues ,  he said . still , through friday , moody ' s has said in the fourth quarter it may downgrade 47 companies , and upgrade just four . copyright ?

' state govt . to renegotiate dabhol power project , by hubert vaz the economic times , friday apr 27 2001 dpc board empowers md to cancel mseb contract the enron power project crisis on thursday deepened with the board of dabhol power company authorising the management to issue a termination notice to the maharashtra state electricity board even while international lenders to the project asked enron to renegotiate power purchase agreement signed with the mseb . the decision to authorise managing director neil mcgregor to issue  notice of termination on the contract to sell 740 mw of power  was taken after the board prevented mseb from voting on the ground that it was an interested party . the decision was taken with six votes in favour and the single opposition vote was cast by idbi , sources said . according to reports , financial institutions such as anz investment bank , credit suisse first boston , citibank , abn - amro and the state bank of india have on wednesday advised enron against terminating its ppa with mseb . mseb chairman vinay bansal , who with two other directors attended the meeting on wednesday representing maharashtra ' s 15 per cent stake in the near $ 3 - billion project , said :  the indian side told them that it would be unfortunate if enron broke the contract .  while bansal declined comment on the board decision , the sources said the indian side had expressed its interest to holds talks on the issue rather than terminating the project and there were possibilities of a fresh power purchase agreement between the company and the state . ( pti ) the economic times , friday apr 27 2001 mseb pays rs 134 cr under ' protest ' to dpc despite the threat of a possible termination notice hanging on its head , maharashtra state electricity board on thursday made a  protest payment  of rs 134 crore disputed amount , towards march bill of rs 146 . 64 crore to dabhol .  we were ready with the payment on wednesday itself , but dpc officials could not collect the cheque due to the statewide bandh  , a senior mseb official said .  we have disputed payment of rs 12 . 64 crore and it would be now taken up at the disputes resolution forum , of which enron india managing director k wade cline and krishna rao are members  , mseb sources said . last week , dpc had dashed off a communication to the government and mseb that it would not accept  protest payments  anymore . cline had said the energy major shall treat such payments as an election to pay the sums , which mseb in fact owed dpc in full and that the company would also not recognise the  purported protest or reservation  . mseb had paid a rs 113 . 5 crore february bill in protest last month . on april 23 last , both domestic and international lenders of dpc had met in london and held exhaustive discussions the multinational ' s move to issue a termination notice to mseb and state government . ( pti ) business standard , friday , april 27 , 001 enron india md authorised to terminate ppa the board of the enron - promoted dabhol power company ( dpc ) , at its meeting in london on wednesday , authorised the managing director of enron india to issue a notice for terminating the power purchase agreement to the maharashtra state electricity board and the state government .  the board has authorised wade cline to serve the termination notice . however , this does not mean that the termination notice will be served immediately . it is only an enabling provision and will be used only if the situation arises ,  a state government source told business standard from london . he said dpc was under pressure from its lenders . the dpc spokesperson here refused to comment on the issue . the hardening of the board ' s stand is in sharp contrast to the advice of dpc ' s lenders , who had warned enron not to precipitate matters by issuing a termination notice . the lenders had arrived at a consensus that the termination notice need not be served at this stage . serving of the notice requires a nod from the lenders , who have an exposure of about $ 2 billion in the project . sources said given the lenders ' strong opposition to termination of the contract , the enron board ' s  enabling resolution  did not have much significance beyond conveying a hardening of its stand with regard to the current imbroglio . the maharashtra chief minister had warned enron not to scuttle the process of crisis resolution by issuing a termination notice . the state government is to nominate an expert group to renegotiate the terms of the dabhol contract . enron holds 65 per cent in dpc , while us - based ge and bechtel hold 10 per cent each . the balance 15 per cent is held by mseb through a special purpose vehicle , maharashtra power development corporation . the mseb representatives were not allowed to vote at the meeting since they were an interested party . the idbi representative protested against the board ' s decision . the meeting was attended by state energy secretary vm lal . the meeting was held against the backdrop of a dispute between mseb and dpc over payment of bills . after mseb failed to pay rs 102 crore towards the december 2000 bill , dpc invoked the state government ' s guarantee and then the union government ' s counter guarantee . when payment of the rs 127 - crore january bill became overdue , dpc again invoked the state government ' s guarantee . mseb retaliated on january 28 , 2001 by slapping a rs 401 - crore penalty for non - supply of electricity at adequate levels . it demanded that dpc adjust the bills against this penalty .  this stand of mseb was explained to dpc at the board meeting  , a state government official said . the centre also supported mseb ' s stand and refused to honour the counter guarantee . the power company then invoked the political force majeure clause . a process of conciliation and arbitration between the centre and dpc is currently on . the financial express , friday , april 27 , 2001 foreign lenders slam brakes on disbursements to dpc , sanjay jog & raghu mohan global banks comfortable with enron pull - out lenders to the dabhol power company ( dpc ) are a sharply divided lot . international lenders , in direct contrast to the stand taken by local ones led by the the industrial develoment bank of india ( idbi ) , are categorical that additional assistance to dpc ' s phase - ii will be held in abeyance despite the completion of 92 per cent of the project work . the stage is also set for a preliminary termination notice to be served by dpc to the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) within the next four weeks . this follows the authorisation given to enron india ' s managing director k wade cline and dpc president & ceo neil mcgregor to serve the termination notice , and transfer notices to mseb , following wednesday ' s dpc board meeting in london . the essence of the message from the international lenders following the london meeting with dpc board is : emotions do not work . contractual obligations and payments have to be met . we are convinced that the mseb has failed to meet its obligations . there is no point in enron continuing with the project and the company should get out of it . the structuring of dpc ' s debt has created two classes of lenders . in phase - i , international lenders are covered by a sovereign guarantee while in phase - ii , no lender is . however , all lenders have a parri passu charge , making attachment of assets a messy affair . sources in international banks were quick to point out that local lenders to phase - ii of the project are worried that an awry dpc project will affect their interests more given that they have no security - other than assets - like a sovereign cover .  it was this desperation that made local lenders like idbi slash the interest rates a few months back to 16 . 5 per cent from 21 . 5 per cent ,  a leading foreign banker pointed out . three points that were made clear and stressed in no uncertain terms by international lenders were : a ) there are contractual obligations b ) mseb was not punctual in its payments to dpc and c ) mseb adopted a confrontational position by slapping a rs 401 crore rebate charge on dpc for misdeclaration and default on the availability of power . while local lenders led by idbi - with mseb parroting the same - were of the view that the current situation is a temporary one , international lenders were steadfast that pulling out of the project is the only way out . this is despite the stance taken by idbi and mseb that authorisation for termination given to mr cline and mr mcgregor was not called for . international bankers pointed out that they will now have to look at the issue of charges and protection for their loans in the event of the power project being scrapped in its present form . the points of contention are : a ) that phase - i of dpc is backed by a sovereign guarantee b ) phase - ii is not and c ) to the extent that phase - ii is covered by assets , cancellation of phase - ii may see all assets - even those under phase - i - getting attached . therefore , an examination on the segregation of assets under phase - i and phase - ii is now warranted . pti adds : in a significant move , dpc board has empowered its management to sever power supply agreement with mseb , a move that could inflict a financial liability of about rs 2840 crore on the centre . a decision to authorise dpc president neil mcgregor to issue a termination notice to mseb for sale of power was taken by the board at its meeting on wednesday . the indian express , friday , april 27 , 2001 enron : dabhol chief gets powers to end deal with the mseb the board of dabhol power company , a subsidiary of houston - based enron corp , has decided to warn the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) that it intends to pull the plug on its guhagar - based project . in a board meeting held in london on wednesday , the board decided to authorise dpc president and ceo neil mcgregor and enron india ' s managing director k wade cline to serve a ' ' preliminary ' ' termination notice for sale of power to the mseb within the next four weeks . the dabhol project has been mired in disputes since mseb began missing payments last year . mseb owes dabhol power $ 48 million for power delivered in december and january . the payment ran into a dispute after mseb slapped penalty notices of rs 401 crore on dpc for its failure to supply power within three hours of the demand being placed . but mseb has paid $ 24 million for february . and a payment of $ 31 million was made for march on thursday . the $ 3 billion dabhol project is the largest foreign investment made in india to date . issuing the preliminary termination notice could enable dabhol to suspend deliveries as it negotiates payment disputes . while a preliminary termination notice is the first of three steps that could potentially lead to the abandonment of the project by enron , analysts have described the decision as a ' ' procedural ' ' move consistent with dpc ' s negotiating strategy to recover overdue payments from the mseb . after the company issues the preliminary termination notice , step two would be an official termination notice , and step three would be a notice that the company is surrendering control of the project . if the project is terminated , the government of india will have to take a hit of $ 300 million besides paying bills of rs 1 , 500 crore for the next one year to enron as penalty . ' ' our ( centre ' s ) liability , if dabhol power project is terminated , would be one year ' s electricity bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million , ' ' power secretary a k basu said . ' ' contractually , the centre will have to pay one year ' s electricity bill , totalling at present prices about rs 1 , 400 - 1 , 500 crore , and take over dpc ' s debt , which stands at around $ 300 million , if the project was terminated , ' ' basu said in delhi . dabhol power is in the process of completing the second phase of the 2 , 184 - megawatt power - plant project , which is 95 per cent through . while the international lenders to the project are pressurising the company to get out of the project , indian lenders , led by idbi , are asking the company to reconsider its decision on its termination notice . during the meeting in london , mseb which holds a 15 per cent stake in the project , had strongly opposed dpc ' s move to authorise cline and mcgregor to issue notices for termination . mseb chairman vinay bansal and technical director prem paunikar - both directors on the dpc board - and the state principal secretary ( energy ) vm lal , an invitee to the board , raised the issue at the board meeting in london . mseb claimed that dpc was needlessly ' ' threatening ' ' to issue various arbitration notices and thereby interpreting the clauses of ppa in isolation . in recent weeks , dabhol has raised the stakes in its spat with the mseb , delivering a notice of political force majeure to maharashtra - a step typically invoked to dissolve a contract in case of an emergency like a war , coup , or a similar radical political event . in this case , dpc ' s move was viewed as a threat to stop providing electricity . dpc has come under fire because of the relatively high cost of its power . critics object to the company charging rs 7 . 1 a kilowatt - hour for its power , compared with around rs 1 . 5 a kilowatt - hour charged by other suppliers . the hindu , friday , april 27 , 2001 offer of renegotiation ' too late ' : enron , by mahesh vijapurkar mumbai , april 26 . the enron - sponsored dabhol power company , which last night authorised its local management to issue a notice of termination of its power purchase agreement ( ppa ) with the maharashtra state electricity board , has decided to keep a stiff upper lip . this , in turn , has stoked speculation that the switching off of power from its phase i plant was imminent , while in reality , a lengthy procedure has to be followed as prescribed within the ppa . as one source familiar with the ppa told the hindu , ` ` it is not sudden death of the project ' ' and in all probability , the dpc , vexed with the developments , including sharp and pointed observations by the godbole committee , has chosen to only arm itself with a serious option . ` ` this would only eventually come into effect . it is not an overnight operation and a lot of legal work is involved ' ' . apparently , the dpc intends to do some arm - twisting . at the board of directors meeting in london , which maharashtra was initially disinclined to attend but later used the forum to put across its contentions on the project , the dpc squarely told the mseb nominees on the board that the offer of renegotiation had come rather ` ` too late ' ' . it also said it did not see any room for optimism about the outcome . it did not , however , rule out the option of talks , thus underscoring the possibility that the decision to authorise termination was a new weapon . the maharashtra chief minister , mr . vilasrao deshmukh , had hoped that dpc would not take any ` ` harsh step ' ' which would cause lot of damage to the interests of both the independent power producer and the government and today he expressed his dismay . in fact , the mandate of the team that went , on the strength of its stake in the dpc , was to put across the idea that negotiation was the requirement and not confrontation . echo in ls the enron issue also echoed in the lok sabha today where the power minister , mr . suresh prabhu , said that scrapping of the agreement would cost the centre rs . 2 , 840 crores , whose liability in the project agreement was limited . the centre ' s liability in case of termination is one year ' s electricity bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million . blow to fis the termination could prove to be a serious blow to the indian financial institutions ( fis ) which , under the leadership of the idbi , were trying to convince the other lenders of the project against the notice . the exposure of indian fis in the project is understood to be not covered by any guarantee either of the centre or the state . the times of india , friday , 27 april 2001 enron ready to pull out , but lenders say wait the dabhol power company board , which met on wednesday in london , authorised the company management to issue a termination notice to the maharashtra state electricity board . the company , however , may not pull out of the project yet , considering its lenders , who met on monday , opposed such a move and favoured renegotiations . sources present during both the meetings said that though foreign lenders supported enron on the termination issue , domestic financial institutions , led by the industrial development bank of india , prevailed over the deliberations to oppose any such drastic move . enron needs the lenders ' consent to file a pre - termination notice for pulling out from the project . the decision to empower dpc chief wade cline to issue a termination notice was taken with six votes in favour against a single idbi vote against such a move . another significant development during the entire proceedings was that the financial institutions made it clear that further funding of phase ii of the project will depend on the government of india assuring payment mechanisms . institutions are yet to disburse about 30 per cent of the sanctioned package , which is crucial for completing the phase ii expansion project . ` ` the board has given powers to wade cline to issue a pre - termination notice . but the meeting quite unanimously felt the need of the hour is not to terminate the project but to initiate serious re - negotiation proceedings , ' ' said mseb chairman vinay bansal , who attended the board meeting . ` ` mseb presented their views to the board members and it was understood by enron which also included the rs 401 crore penalty issue which is heading for arbitration proceedings . ` ` we have also made it clear that the tariff structure of enron is quite high and a downward revision of tariffs is unavoidable ,  bansal added . ` ` they cannot issue a termination notice without our consent since our exposure in the project is quite large and the lenders should approve any plans in that direction , ' ' said a top banker who was present during the lenders ' meet . ` ` there is a general consensus that the project must be completed and the proposal to terminate the ppa should be kept in abeyance , ' ' he added . the global arrangers for the dpc include anz investment bank , credit suisse first boston , abn - amro , citibank and the state bank of india , where all these parties conducted separate meetings with the company officials . however , some bankers said the company can file a termination notice even if one lender with a minimum 5 per cent exposure on the project favours such proceedings . meanwhile , in a clear reversal of roles , maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said that the state government was not keen on terminating the ppa . ` ` we will ask them to refrain from taking any such harsh steps since that would be bad news for all of us , including dpc , ' ' deshmukh said . deshmukh was echoing union power minister suresh prabhu ' s sentiments , who said that the government wanted an amicable settlement of the payment row . he , however , added that termination of the project would not hurt foreign investments , and dismissed warnings by analysts that winding up the $ 2 . 9 billion project would be a blow to india ' s efforts to woo foreign investors . the dpc has already slapped one conciliation notice on the centre and three arbitration notices on the state government over non - payment of dues amounting to rs 213 crore and interest towards the bills due for december 2000 and january 2001 . meanwhile , mseb officials said in mumbai that the march bills amounting to rs 134 crore was paid on thursday as protest payment , despite the dispute over the amount . when asked on the future course of action , bansal said it was up to the dpc . the hindu businessline , friday , april 27 , 2001 dpc board authorises md to issue ppa termination notice the board of directors of dabhol power company ( dpc ) has authorised the managing director , mr neil mcgregor , to issue the notice of intent to terminate its power purchase agreement ( ppa ) with the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) ` ` at an appropriate time ' ' . the decision was taken at a board meeting held in london yesterday . ` ` while mseb , which is an ` interested party ' , was not allowed to vote , it made a presentation clarifying its stand on the matter , ' ' a senior state government official said . the resolution to authorise the management to issue the termination notice was carried by six votes to one . idbi voted against the decision , the official said . the serving of the preliminary termination notice will lead to a six - month ` ` suspension period ' ' . according to clause 17 . 8 of the termination procedure , of the ppa : ` ` following the giving of a preliminary termination notice , the parties shall consult for a period of six months ( or such longer period as they may agree ) as to what step shall be taken with a view to mitigating the consequences of the relevant event having regard to all the circumstances . . . ' ' idbi and state bank of india , the principal indian lenders , had earlier persuaded the overseas lenders to hold their consent to the termination notice for some more time . at least one lender has to consent for the company to serve termination notice . it is understood that overseas lenders are in favour of termination of the project and are prepared to consent . however , domestic lenders are worried about the security of their advances if the ppa is abandoned mid - way . according to institutional sources , indian lenders are trying to get all the parties concerned to thrash out outstanding issues . the maharashtra and central governments too are in favour of a conciliation . mr vilasrao deshmukh , chief minister of maharashtra , yesterday went on record that the state did not want the project terminated . mr yashwant sinha , union finance minister , is also understood to be of the same opinion . ` ` the dpc will now have to decide what is the ` appropriate time ' to serve the notice , ' ' the official said . mseb pays rs 134 crore : meanwhile , mseb has paid dpc rs 134 crore towards its march 2001 bill . mseb officials confirmed that the bill was paid ` in protest ' ' today morning . ` ` they ( dpc ) had billed us for an amount of rs 146 crore . we do not agree with some of the items included , ' ' a senior mseb official said . the pioneer , friday , april 27 , 2001 enron testing maharashtra ' s nerves , t n raghunatha dabhol power company ( dpc ) has begun to put fresh pressure on the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) , the maharashtra state government and the centre for an early resolution to the prolonged dispute between them , if the dpc board of directors ' decision to authorise its managing director to serve a contract termination notice to the mseb is any indication . the dpc board , in its meeting in london on wednesday , empowered the company management to sever its power supply agreement with mseb , a move that could inflict a financial liability of rs 2 , 840 crore on the centre . the decision to authorise the dpc management to issue a termination notice to mseb was taken by a vote of six to one after the maharasthra government representatives were prevented from voting on the ground of  interested party  . when contacted , the company ' s mumbai - based spokesperson , mr jimmy mogal , declined to comment on the reports about the decision taken by the dpc board .  we have nothing to say on the reports emanating from london . we will express our views after a few days ,  he said . however , maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh on thursday termed the dpc board ' s decision as  unfortunate  .  we have already requested the company not to take any harsh decision  , mr deshmukh said in mumbai . official sources in the state energy ministry interpreted the dpc board ' s decision as a pressure tactic employed by the enron subsidiary to force the mseb to clear the pending power bills without any further delay . through its tough posture , the dpc wants to make its position stronger before it can formally agree for re - negotiations with the mseb , the centre and the state government for cutting the price of power supplied by it to the state electricity board . the sources said that the dpc ' s reported decision to authorise its managing director to stop electricity supply to the mseb did not mean that the enron subsidiary would actually go ahead with the scrapping of the power contract with the mseb .  if anything , the dpc ' s reported decision is to mount additional pressure on the mseb for clearance of pending power bills and put itself in a stronger position in settling its dispute with the mseb . as part of its plan to arm itself with powers to break a contract in case situation goes beyond its control , the dpc had recently served a political force majeure to the mseb , the centre and the state government ,  the sources said . not surprisingly , the dpc ' s london decision comes on the heels of the maharashtra government ' s decision to set up a high - level committee , comprising representatives of the mseb , the centre and the state government to re - negotiate with the enron ' s subsidiary company for reducing the cost of power supplied to the state electricity board . meanwhile , amidst the threat of a possible termination notice hanging on its head , the mseb on thursday made a  protest payment  of the rs 134 crore disputed amount towards march bill of rs 146 . 64 crore to dpc . riday , april 27 the telegraph , friday , april 27 , 2001 enron signal to switch off dabhol power enron today took the first decisive step out of the controversy - ridden dabhol power company when it won an authorisation from the company ' s board to stop sale of power to maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) . the meeting of the company , of which the houston - based energy giant holds 65 per cent and the mseb 15 per cent , was attended by state energy secretary v m lal and mseb technical director p paunikar and it came days after its lenders discussed payment problems and a possible termination . the centre ' s liability , if enron decides to snap the agreement , will be a year ' s power bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million . however , the company will have to wait for six months from the day it serves the notice before it pulls the plug . the centre shrugged off the move , saying there would not be any adverse effect on foreign investment in power if enron walks out .  we do not see fdi inflows into the power sector being hit ,  power minister suresh prabhu said . mseb officials said the ball is now in the court of dpc , which said its corporate policy did not allow it to comment on proceedings at board meetings . the decision coincided with a rs 134 - crore ' protest payment ' by the cash - strapped power board as part of the march bill worth rs 146 . 64 crore . there was speculation that mseb coughed up the amount to cool frayed tempers at enron ' s hub in houston , and because it was rattled by the sudden turn of events in the past few days during which the dispute had come to a head . mseb officials brushed away the allusions , saying the cheque was ready on wednesday but could not be handed over to dpc because of the state - wide bandh .  we have a disputed payment of rs 12 . 64 crore , which will be taken up at the dispute - resolution forum ,  a board official said . last week , dpc told the state government and mseb it would no longer accept protest payments in a move to fortify its legal position . mseb officials say bechtel and general electric , the other partners who hold around 20 per cent in dpc , are willing to go along with enron corp in terminating the deal but financial institutions such as idbi are not game because it puts their loans at risk . investments made by indian institutions are not covered under the centre ' s and state ' s counter - guarantees , unlike those made by international lenders . maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh called enron ' s decision unfortunate .  we had told state government officials attending the enron board meeting to stop the company from winding up its operations in the state as it will harm both parties .  the statesman , friday , april 27 , 2001 enron threatens to pull out the enron crisis deepened with the board of directors of the dabhol power company deciding to authorise the managing director , mr k wade cline , to serve a notice of termination on the contract for the first phase of the $ 2 . 9 billion power project . the decision , which could lead to the cessation of dabhol ' s power supply to the state , was taken at the meeting held yesterday in london according to reports quoting the chairman of the maharashtra state electricity board , mr vinay bansal . while dpc officials refuse to comment on anything , it is learnt that mseb was itself prepared to serve a legal notice of termination just two days before the meeting . mseb was said to have been dissuaded by the nationalist congress party president , mr sharad pawar , and union power minister mr suresh prabhu , who had talks in new delhi with the maharashtra chief minister , mr vilasrao deshmukh , and an mseb delegation last monday . the state government has been served two arbitration notices while the centre is ready to go for conciliation with the dpc for failing to honour its counter - guarantee . further , the dpc has already slapped a notice of political force majeure which protects itself against undeserved claims in the event of exigencies that force it to take an extreme step . the union power minister , mr suresh prabhu , contended in delh"

And it's even beginning to be trusted for news, well past BBC and taking share from every other government broadcaster.It is as hard to imagine America losing a war of ideas in the long-term as it is to imagine America making any headway at all in the short term.Many of you may disagree, but I found the document below surprisingly centrist. If you know the code, you can hear clearly partisan tones, re: ICC, Taiwan Relations Act, etc. But, still, this is as much a Democratic platform as not. Africa and AIDS take up more mindshare than I feared they might.As you read, replace United States with Roman Empire and it may make as much sense, in the long view of history. I don't know how proud to be about that, but it is telling. Sometime I daydream that the President might sit down with the nation with Perotista flip charts and explain to our citizens the sheer vastness of our 700+ military installations overseas and what they do for us. It would be a powerful education on how engaged we are in the world around us.Heck, I'd love to see a real-time map of Federal expenditures around the globe, a softly glowing necklace of embassies, carriers, arctic research stations, hotels, golf courses, warehouses, libraries, clinics and all the rest of the influence a trillion dollars here or there can buy.Of course, this still doesn't leave me any more comfortable with the real news in this document: the Bush Doctrine for pre-emptive strikes. I'd sooner repeal the Church amendments on covert action than permit such a principle to be loosed upon the world.Rohit-----------------------------------------------------September 20, 2002Full Text: Bush's National Security StrategyFollowing is the full text of President Bush's new national security strategy. The document, entitled The National Security Strategy of the United States, will soon be transmitted to Congress as a declaration of the Administration's policy.INTRODUCTIONTHE great struggles of the twentieth century between liberty and totalitarianism ended with a decisive victory for the forces of freedom -- and a single sustainable model for national success: freedom, democracy, and free enterprise. In the twenty-first century, only nations that share a commitment to protecting basic human rights and guaranteeing political and economic freedom will be able to unleash the potential of their people and assure their future prosperity. People everywhere want to say what they think, choose who will govern them, worship as they please, educate their children -- male and female, own property, and enjoy the benefits of their labor. These values of freedom are right and true for every person, in every society -- and the duty of protecting these values against their enemies is the common calling of freedom-loving people across the globe and across the ages.Today, the United States enjoys a position of unparalleled military strength and great economic and political influence. In keeping with our heritage and principles, we do not use our strength to press for unilateral advantage. We seek instead to create a balance of power that favors human freedom: conditions in which all nations and all societies can choose for themselves the rewards and challenges of political and economic liberty. By making the world safer, we allow the people of the world to make their own lives better. We will defend this just peace against threats from terrorists and tyrants. We will preserve the peace by building good relations among the great powers. We will extend the peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent.Defending our Nation against its enemies is the first and fundamental commitment of the Federal Government. Today, that task has changed dramatically. Enemies in the past needed great armies and great industrial capabilities to endanger America. Now, shadowy networks of individuals can bring great chaos and suffering to our shores for less than it costs to purchase a single tank. Terrorists are organized to penetrate open societies and to turn the power of modern technologies against us.To defeat this threat we must make use of every tool in our arsenal -- from better homeland defenses and law enforcement to intelligence and cutting off terrorist financing. The war against terrorists of global reach is a global enterprise of uncertain duration. America will help nations that need our assistance in combating terror. And America will hold to account nations that are compromised by terror -- because the allies of terror are the enemies of civilization. The United States and countries cooperating with us must not allow the terrorists to develop new home bases. Together, we will seek to deny them sanctuary at every turn.The gravest danger our Nation faces lies at the crossroads of radicalism and technology. Our enemies have openly declared that they are seeking weapons of mass destruction, and evidence indicates that they are doing so with determination. The United States will not allow these efforts to succeed. We will build defenses against ballistic missiles and other means of delivery. We will cooperate with other nations to deny, contain, and curtail our enemies' efforts to acquire dangerous technologies. And, as a matter of common sense and self-defense, America will act against such emerging threats before they are fully formed. We cannot defend America and our friends by hoping for the best. So we must be prepared to defeat our enemies' plans, using the best intelligence and proceeding with deliberation. History will judge harshly those who saw this coming danger but failed to act. In the new world we have entered, the only path to safety is the path of action.As we defend the peace, we will also take advantage of an historic opportunity to preserve the peace. Today, the international community has the best chance since the rise of the nation-state in the seventeenth century to build a world where great powers compete in peace instead of continually prepare for war. Today, the world's great powers find ourselves on the same side -- united by common dangers of terrorist violence and chaos. The United States will build on these common interests to promote global security. We are also increasingly united by common values. Russia is in the midst of a hopeful transition, reaching for its democratic future and a partner in the war on terror. Chinese leaders are discovering that economic freedom is the only source of national wealth. In time, they will find that social and political freedom is the only source of national greatness. America will encourage the advancement of democracy and economic openness in both nations, because these are the best foundations for domestic stability and international order. We will strongly resist aggression from other great powers -- even as we welcome their peaceful pursuit of prosperity, trade, and cultural advancement.Finally, the United States will use this moment of opportunity to extend the benefits of freedom across the globe. We will actively work to bring the hope of democracy, development, free markets, and free trade to every corner of the world. The events of September 11, 2001, taught us that weak states, like Afghanistan, can pose as great a danger to our national interests as strong states. Poverty does not make poor people into terrorists and murderers. Yet poverty, weak institutions, and corruption can make weak states vulnerable to terrorist networks and drug cartels within their borders.The United States will stand beside any nation determined to build a better future by seeking the rewards of liberty for its people. Free trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift whole societies out of poverty -- so the United States will work with individual nations, entire regions, and the entire global trading community to build a world that trades in freedom and therefore grows in prosperity. The United States will deliver greater development assistance through the New Millennium Challenge Account to nations that govern justly, invest in their people, and encourage economic freedom. We will also continue to lead the world in efforts to reduce the terrible toll of AIDS and other infectious diseases.In building a balance of power that favors freedom, the United States is guided by the conviction that all nations have important responsibilities. Nations that enjoy freedom must actively fight terror. Nations that depend on international stability must help prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction. Nations that seek international aid must govern themselves wisely, so that aid is well spent. For freedom to thrive, accountability must be expected and required.We are also guided by the conviction that no nation can build a safer, better world alone. Alliances and multilateral institutions can multiply the strength of freedom-loving nations. The United States is committed to lasting institutions like the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, the Organization of American States, and NATO as well as other long-standing alliances. Coalitions of the willing can augment these permanent institutions. In all cases, international obligations are to be taken seriously. They are not to be undertaken symbolically to rally support for an ideal without furthering its attainment.Freedom is the non-negotiable demand of human dignity, the birthright of every person -- in every civilization. Throughout history, freedom has been threatened by war and terror, it has been challenged by the clashing wills of powerful states and the evil designs of tyrants, and it has been tested by widespread poverty and disease. Today, humanity holds in its hands the opportunity to further freedom's triumph over all these foes. The United States welcomes our responsibility to lead in this great mission.I. Overview of America's International StrategyOur Nation's cause has always been larger than our Nation's defense. We fight, as we always fight, for a just peace -- a peace that favors liberty. We will defend the peace against the threats from terrorists and tyrants. We will preserve the peace by building good relations among the great powers. And we will extend the peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent.President BushWest Point, New YorkJune 1, 2002The United States possesses unprecedented -- and unequaled -- strength and influence in the world. Sustained by faith in the principles of liberty, and the value of a free society, this position comes with unparalleled responsibilities, obligations, and opportunity. The great strength of this nation must be used to promote a balance of power that favors freedom.For most of the twentieth century, the world was divided by a great struggle over ideas: destructive totalitarian visions versus freedom and equality.That great struggle is over. The militant visions of class, nation, and race which promised utopia and delivered misery have been defeated and discredited. America is now threatened less by conquering states than we are by failing ones. We are menaced less by fleets and armies than by catastrophic technologies in the hands of the embittered few. We must defeat these threats to our Nation, allies, and friends.This is also a time of opportunity for America. We will work to translate this moment of influence into decades of peace, prosperity, and liberty. The U.S. national security strategy will be based on a distinctly American internationalism that reflects the union of our values and our national interests. The aim of this strategy is to help make the world not just safer but better. Our goals on the path to progress are clear: political and economic freedom, peaceful relations with other states, and respect for human dignity.And this path is not America's alone. It is open to all.To achieve these goals, the United States will:*	champion aspirations for human dignity,*	strengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and work to prevent attacks against us and our friends,*	work with others to defuse regional conflicts,*	prevent our enemies from threatening us, our allies, and our friends, with weapons of mass destruction,*	ignite a new era of global economic growth through free markets and free trade,*	expand the circle of development by opening societies and building the infrastructure of democracy,*	develop agendas for cooperative action with other main centers of global power, and*	transform America's national security institutions to meet the challenges and opportunities of the twenty-first century.II. Champion Aspirations for Human DignitySome worry that it is somehow undiplomatic or impolite to speak the language of right and wrong. I disagree. Different circumstances require different methods, but not different moralities.President BushWest Point, New YorkJune 1, 2002In pursuit of our goals, our first imperative is to clarify what we stand for: the United States must defend liberty and justice because these principles are right and true for all people everywhere. No nation owns these aspirations, and no nation is exempt from them. Fathers and mothers in all societies want their children to be educated and to live free from poverty and violence. No people on earth yearn to be oppressed, aspire to servitude, or eagerly await the midnight knock of the secret police.America must stand firmly for the nonnegotiable demands of human dignity: the rule of law, limits on the absolute power of the state, free speech, freedom of worship, equal justice, respect for women, religious and ethnic tolerance, and respect for private property.These demands can be met in many ways. America's constitution has served us well. Many other nations, with different histories and cultures, facing different circumstances, have successfully incorporated these core principles into their own systems of governance. History has not been kind to those nations which ignored or flouted the rights and aspirations of their people.Our own history is a long struggle to live up to our ideals. But even in our worst moments, the principles enshrined in the Declaration of Independence were there to guide us. As a result, America is not just a stronger, but is a freer and more just society.Today, these ideals are a lifeline to lonely defenders of liberty. And when openings arrive, we can encourage change -- as we did in central and eastern Europe between 1989 and 1991, or in Belgrade in 2000. When we see democratic processes take hold among our friends in Taiwan or in the Republic of Korea, and see elected leaders replace generals in Latin America and Africa, we see examples of how authoritarian systems can evolve, marrying local history and traditions with the principles we all cherish.Embodying lessons from our past and using the opportunity we have today, the national security strategy of the United States must start from these core beliefs and look outward for possibilities to expand liberty.Our principles will guide our government's decisions about international cooperation, the character of our foreign assistance, and the allocation of resources. They will guide our actions and our words in international bodies.We will:*	speak out honestly about violations of the nonnegotiable demands of human dignity using our voice and vote in international institutions to advance freedom,*	use our foreign aid to promote freedom and support those who struggle non-violently for it, ensuring that nations moving toward democracy are rewarded for the steps they take,*	make freedom and the development of democratic institutions key themes in our bilateral relations, seeking solidarity and cooperation from other democracies while we press governments that deny human rights to move toward a better future, and*	take special efforts to promote freedom of religion and conscience and defend it from encroachment by repressive governments.We will champion the cause of human dignity and oppose those who resist it.III. Strengthen Alliances to Defeat Global Terrorism and Work to Prevent Attacks Against Us and Our FriendsJust three days removed from these events, Americans do not yet have the distance of history. But our responsibility to history is already clear: to answer these attacks and rid the world of evil. War has been waged against us by stealth and deceit and murder. This nation is peaceful, but fierce when stirred to anger. The conflict was begun on the timing and terms of others. It will end in a way, and at an hour, of our choosing.President BushWashington, D.C. (The National Cathedral)September 14, 2001The United States of America is fighting a war against terrorists of global reach. The enemy is not a single political regime or person or religion or ideology. The enemy is terrorism -- premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against innocents.In many regions, legitimate grievances prevent the emergence of a lasting peace. Such grievances deserve to be, and must be, addressed within a political process. But no cause justifies terror. The United States will make no concessions to terrorist demands and strike no deals with them. We make no distinction between terrorists and those who knowingly harbor or provide aid to them.The struggle against global terrorism is different from any other war in our history. It will be fought on many fronts against a particularly elusive enemy over an extended period of time. Progress will come through the persistent accumulation of successes -- some seen, some unseen.Today our enemies have seen the results of what civilized nations can, and will, do against regimes that harbor, support, and use terrorism to achieve their political goals. Afghanistan has been liberated, coalition forces continue to hunt down the Taliban and al-Qaida. But it is not only this battlefield on which we will engage terrorists. Thousands of trained terrorists remain at large with cells in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and across Asia.Our priority will be first to disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations of global reach and attack their leadership, command, control, and communications, material support, and finances. This will have a disabling effect upon the terrorists' ability to plan and operate.We will continue to encourage our regional partners to take up a coordinated effort that isolates the terrorists. Once the regional campaign localizes the threat to a particular state, we will help ensure the state has the military, law enforcement, political, and financial tools necessary to finish the task.The United States will continue to work with our allies to disrupt the financing of terrorism. We will identify and block the sources of funding for terrorism, freeze the assets of terrorists and those who support them, deny terrorists access to the international financial system, protect legitimate charities from being abused by terrorists, and prevent the movement of terrorists' assets through alternative financial networks.However, this campaign need not be sequential to be effective, the cumulative effect across all regions will help achieve the results we seek.We will disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations by:*	direct and continuous action using all the elements of national and international power. Our immediate focus will be those terrorist organizations of global reach and any terrorist or state sponsor of terrorism which attempts to gain or use weapons of mass destruction (WMD) or their precursors,*	defending the United States, the American people, and our interests at home and abroad by identifying and destroying the threat before it reaches our borders. While the United States will constantly strive to enlist the support of the international community, we will not hesitate to act alone, if necessary, to exercise our right of self-defense by acting preemptively against such terrorists, to prevent them from doing harm against our people and our country, and*	denying further sponsorship, support, and sanctuary to terrorists by convincing or compelling states to accept their sovereign responsibilities.We will also wage a war of ideas to win the battle against international terrorism. This includes:*	using the full influence of the United States, and working closely with allies and friends, to make clear that all acts of terrorism are illegitimate so that terrorism will be viewed in the same light as slavery, piracy, or genocide: behavior that no respectable government can condone or support and all must oppose,*	supporting moderate and modern government, especially in the Muslim world, to ensure that the conditions and ideologies that promote terrorism do not find fertile ground in any nation,*	diminishing the underlying conditions that spawn terrorism by enlisting the international community to focus its efforts and resources on areas most at risk, and*	using effective public diplomacy to promote the free flow of information and ideas to kindle the hopes and aspirations of freedom of those in societies ruled by the sponsors of global terrorism.While we recognize that our best defense is a good offense we are also strengthening America's homeland security to protect against and deter attack.This Administration has proposed the largest government reorganization since the Truman Administration created the National Security Council and the Department of Defense. Centered on a new Department of Homeland Security and including a new unified military command and a fundamental reordering of the FBI, our comprehensive plan to secure the homeland encompasses every level of government and the cooperation of the public and the private sector.This strategy will turn adversity into opportunity. For example, emergency management systems will be better able to cope not just with terrorism but with all hazards. Our medical system will be strengthened to manage not just bioterror, but all infectious diseases and mass-casualty dangers. Our border controls will not just stop terrorists, but improve the efficient movement of legitimate traffic.While our focus is protecting America, we know that to defeat terrorism in today's globalized world we need support from our allies and friends. Wherever possible, the United States will rely on regional organizations and state powers to meet their obligations to fight terrorism. Where governments find the fight against terrorism beyond their capacities, we will match their willpower and their resources with whatever help we and our allies can provide.As we pursue the terrorists in Afghanistan, we will continue to work with international organizations such as the United Nations, as well as non-governmental organizations, and other countries to provide the humanitarian, political, economic, and security assistance necessary to rebuild Afghanistan so that it will never again abuse its people, threaten its neighbors, and provide a haven for terroristsIn the war against global terrorism, we will never forget that we are ultimately fighting for our democratic values and way of life. Freedom and fear are at war, and there will be no quick or easy end to this conflict. In leading the campaign against terrorism, we are forging new, productive international relationships and redefining existing ones in ways that meet the challenges of the twenty-first century.IV. Work with Others To Defuse Regional ConflictsWe build a world of justice, or we will live in a world of coercion. The magnitude of our shared responsibilities makes our disagreements look so small.President BushBerlin, GermanyMay 23, 2002Concerned nations must remain actively engaged in critical regional disputes to avoid explosive escalation and minimize human suffering. In an increasingly interconnected world, regional crisis can strain our alliances, rekindle rivalries among the major powers, and create horrifying affronts to human dignity. When violence erupts and states falter, the United States will work with friends and partners to alleviate suffering and restore stability.No doctrine can anticipate every circumstance in which U.S. action -- direct or indirect -- is warranted. We have finite political, economic, and military resources to meet our global priorities. The United States will approach each case with these strategic principles in mind:*	The United States should invest time and resources into building international relationships and institutions that can help manage local crises when they emerge.*	The United States should be realistic about its ability to help those who are unwilling or unready to help themselves. Where and when people are ready to do their part, we will be willing to move decisively.Policies in several key regions offer some illustrations of how we will apply these principles:The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is critical because of the toll of human suffering, because of America's close relationship with the state of Israel and key Arab states, and because of that region's importance to other global priorities of the United States. There can be no peace for either side without freedom for both sides. America stands committed to an independent and democratic Palestine, living beside Israel in peace and security. Like all other people, Palestinians deserve a government that serves their interests, and listens to their voices, and counts their votes. The United States will continue to encourage all parties to step up to their responsibilities as we seek a just and comprehensive settlement to the conflict.The United States, the international donor community, and the World Bank stand ready to work with a reformed Palestinian government on economic development, increased humanitarian assistance and a program to establish, finance, and monitor a truly independent judiciary. If Palestinians embrace democracy, and the rule of law, confront corruption, and firmly reject terror, they can count on American support for the creation of a Palestinian state.Israel also has a large stake in the success of a democratic Palestine. Permanent occupation threatens Israel's identity and democracy. So the United States continues to challenge Israeli leaders to take concrete steps to support the emergence of a viable, credible Palestinian state. As there is progress towards security, Israel forces need to withdraw fully to positions they held prior to September 28, 2000. And consistent with the recommendations of the Mitchell Committee, Israeli settlement activity in the occupied territories must stop. As violence subsides, freedom of movement should be restored, permitting innocent Palestinians to resume work and normal life. The United States can play a crucial role but, ultimately, lasting peace can only come when Israelis and Palestinians resolve the issues and end the conflict between them.In South Asia, the United States has also emphasized the need for India and Pakistan to resolve their disputes. This administration invested time and resources building strong bilateral relations with India and Pakistan. These strong relations then gave us leverage to play a constructive role when tensions in the region became acute. With Pakistan, our bilateral relations have been bolstered by Pakistan's choice to join the war against terror and move toward building a more open and tolerant society. The Administration sees India's potential to become one of the great democratic powers of the twenty-first century and has worked hard to transform our relationship accordingly. Our involvement in this regional dispute, building on earlier investments in bilateral relations, looks first to concrete steps by India and Pakistan that can help defuse military confrontation.Indonesia took courageous steps to create a working democracy and respect for the rule of law. By tolerating ethnic minorities, respecting the rule of law, and accepting open markets, Indonesia may be able to employ the engine of opportunity that has helped lift some of its neighbors out of poverty and desperation. It is the initiative by Indonesia that allows U.S. assistance to make a difference.In the Western Hemisphere we have formed flexible coalitions with countries that share our priorities, particularly Mexico, Brazil, Canada, Chile, and Colombia. Together we will promote a truly democratic hemisphere where our integration advances security, prosperity, opportunity, and hope. We will work with regional institutions, such as the Summit of the Americas process, the Organization of American States (OAS), and the Defense Ministerial of the Americas for the benefit of the entire hemisphere.Parts of Latin America confront regional conflict, especially arising from the violence of drug cartels and their accomplices. This conflict and unrestrained narcotics trafficking could imperil the health and security of the United States. Therefore we have developed an active strategy to help the Andean nations adjust their economies, enforce their laws, defeat terrorist organizations, and cut off the supply of drugs, while -- as important -- we work to reduce the demand for drugs in our own country.In Colombia, we recognize the link between terrorist and extremist groups that challenge the security of the state and drug trafficking activities that help finance the operations of such groups. We are working to help Colombia defend its democratic institutions and defeat illegal armed groups of both the left and right by extending effective sovereignty over the entire national territory and provide basic security to the Colombian people.In Africa, promise and opportunity sit side by side with disease, war, and desperate poverty. This threatens both a core value of the United States -- preserving human dignity -- and our strategic priority -- combating global terror. American interests and American principles, therefore, lead in the same direction: we will work with others for an African continent that lives in liberty, peace, and growing prosperity. Together with our European allies, we must help strengthen Africa's fragile states, help build indigenous capability to secure porous borders, and help build up the law enforcement and intelligence infrastructure to deny havens for terrorists.An ever more lethal environment exists in Africa as local civil wars spread beyond borders to create regional war zones. Forming coalitions of the willing and cooperative security arrangements are key to confronting these emerging transnational threats.Africa's great size and diversity requires a security strategy that focuses bilateral engagement, and builds coalitions of the willing. This administration will focus on three interlocking strategies for the region:*	countries with major impact on their neighborhood such as South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, and Ethiopia are anchors for regional engagement and require focused attention,*	coordination with European allies and international institutions is essential for constructive conflict mediation and successful peace operations, and*	Africa's capable reforming states and sub-regional organizations must be strengthened as the primary means to address transnational threats on a sustained basis.Ultimately the path of political and economic freedom presents the surest route to progress in sub-Saharan Africa, where most wars are conflicts over material resources and political access often tragically waged on the basis of ethnic and religious difference. The transition to the African Union with its stated commitment to good governance and a common responsibility for democratic political systems offers opportunities to strengthen democracy on the continent.V. Prevent Our Enemies from Threatening Us, Our Allies, and Our Friends with Weapons of Mass DestructionThe gravest danger to freedom lies at the crossroads of radicalism and technology.

fencing required by oregon regulators , and the pending sale of pge to northwestern natural gas ( nwn ) , in addition to its interim status as a subsidiary of ene . the evolving status for pge recognizes that its ratings could drop if the ene / dyn merger were terminated , or improve , if ene ' s credit rating is upgraded in the future . pge ' s credit quality ratios and financial strength are expected to temporarily weaken in 2001 , reflecting the absence of cash recovery of unusually high wholesale power costs . in august 2001 , the oregon public utility commission ( opuc ) authorized higher pge rates , effective october 1 , 2001 , to recover such costs . importantly , the commission order adopted a power cost adjustment mechanism that will allow the company to pass through the lion ' s share of its power procurement costs to customers on a timely basis in the future . the cash recovery of power procurement costs allowed in the opuc order , combined with declining wholesale power procurement costs over the balance of this year should alleviate financial pressure at pge and facilitate improving credit measures in 2002 . the pge ratings consider fitch ' s assessment of nwn ' s acquisition funding plan and the anticipated post - merger holding company structure . nwn recently announced an agreement to acquire pge from ene in a transaction valued at $ 2 . 9 billion , including the assumption of $ 1 . 1 billion of pge debt . the transaction is expected to close by the end of 2002 and requires several regulatory approvals , including the sec , the opuc , and the washington utilities and transportation commission . as part of the transaction , nwn expects to form a new holding company ( holdco ) , which will raise the new debt and equity required to complete the purchase of pge . post - merger , pge and nwn will operate as wholly owned first tier subsidiaries of holdco . as currently contemplated , the approximate $ 1 . 8 billion cash portion will be funded at holdco with approximately 78 % debt and 22 % common equity and hybrid convertible preferred stock . as a result , holdco ' s consolidated and individual credit measures are expected to be relatively weak , as consolidated debt to capitalization could reach 75 % at closing . pge ' s ultimate post - merger ratings will depend on several factors , including , the ability to gain operating synergies from its affiliation with nwn , the credit ratings fitch assigns to holdco , and the structural protections provided pge investors by state utility regulators . the current regulatory ring - fencing applied by the opuc requires pge to maintain a 48 % common equity ratio , thereby limiting the amount of cash pge can dividend up to its parent company . it is expected that similar ring - fencing from the opuc will continue under the new holdco structure . contact : fitch , new york philip smyth , 1 -

( ene ) in the past two weeks , the stock is trading at about its book value , begging the question : so how much is it worth anyway ? the answer is far from easy . ever since enron metamorphosed from a stodgy gas pipeline company into what was seen by many as a dynamic energy trading firm , the company has become increasingly more difficult to understand . just a glance at the wide - range of wall street analysts who follow the company illustrates the point . in the mix are analysts who track natural gas and the pipeline industry as well as those who follow electric utilities . one enticing prospect is that the assets in its portfolio are valuable in and of themselves and could be seen by some as worthwhile acquisition targets . by enron ' s own definition , the company houses four main divisions : enron wholesale services , enron energy services , enron transportation services , and enron broadband services . wholesale services houses the company ' s energy marketing business and enrononline . this segment accounts for the bulk of enron ' s profits , and has become synonymous with what enron means to most people today . not only does enron trade gas , oil and coal , but it also trades commodities such as pulp and paper , petrochemicals , lumber , plastics and even weather risk . enron energy services is the company ' s retail arm . the company provides electricity , gas and commodity risk management services through this division . enron transportation services operates four natural gas pipelines that span about 25 , 000 miles and have a peak capacity of 9 . 8 billion cubic feet per day . through these pipelines the company says it transports about 15 % of the natural gas the u . s . needs . the segment also includes portland general , a oregon utility company enron is selling to northwest natural gas co . ( nwn ) for $ 1 . 9 billion in cash and stock . in addition , the company provides bandwidth and network services through its enron broadband services division . but enron ' s reach is even wider than this list suggests . the company also has a number of other corporate investments , including its stake in the azurix water business , enron renewable energy corp . as well as methanol and mtbe plants . through enron ' s unconsolidated affiliates , the company also has investments in additional water assets , a power plant in india and a natural gas pipeline in argentina among other things . what makes any valuation of enron difficult is what remains unknown about the company ' s financial structure . enron has yet to file a balance sheet for the third quarter , and doesn ' t expect to do so until nov . 15 , when balance sheets must be filed under securities and exchange commission regulations . without the balance sheet , some of the details needed for calculating a company ' s value are missing . also , much still remains unknown about the company ' s obligations to its off - balance sheet financing vehicles . using what is known about enron ' s finances , several analysts have arrived at their own conclusions about valuation . merrill lynch 201 - 938 - 5166 , christina . cheddar @ dowjones . com copyright ?

' ' myers joined the company in november 1999 as it struggled to track costs from acquisitions . he has put new financial - systems software in place and made other efforts to cut costs . the company has also raised prices where it ' s the dominant hauler . myers ' s efforts , along with the sale of overseas businesses , have helped the company regain regard among investors . the shares have risen 22 percent in the past year . pulp and paper most of waste management ' s solid - waste customers produce or consume pulp and paper . waste management collects , processes and sells more than five million tons a year of paper , plastic , glass , aluminum and other metals . recycled - cardboard prices fell 62 percent to $ 48 a ton in the second quarter from $ 125 a year earlier , and the price for recycled newsprint fell to $ 55 a ton from $ 90 , myers said in august . prices were little changed from the second quarter to the third quarter , said steve ragiel , waste management ' s vice president of recycling . waste management , which will report third - quarter results next week , had expected to begin trading in the third quarter . its plans were delayed because it took longer than expected to find people to run the operation , raigel said . jeff harbert , formerly of enron corp . , is heading the operation along with two other enron traders . enron , also based in houston , has created the largest business of trading commodities including electricity , natural gas , pulp and paper . risk management waste management ' s initial focus in the trading business will be on managing its own price risk . it probably only will complete five to 10 trades in each of the first few months , raigel said . the company hopes to set fixed prices for the commodities it picks up , then sell those commodities to a third company , such as a paper producer , at a higher set price . ` ` we ' ll get with a counter party such as a paper mill or a consumer - products company and cut a deal , ' ' raigel said . ` ` we can find a paper mill that wants to lock in a fixed price on what they buy and what they sell . they get a minimum return on their investment and greater control on their raw material costs . ' ' the company hasn ' t said how much it expects to make from trading . analysts aren ' t expecting the business to contribute significantly to waste management ' s earnings . ` ` they are looking at it as a good time to get in on trading but i don ' t see it as a major contributor to their business , ' ' said stewart scharf , an analyst with standard & poor ' s equity group . he rates waste management ` ` accumulate ' ' and doesn ' t own shares . republic services group inc . , the no . 3 u . s . waste company , contracts with individual mills to supply recycled commodities at fixed prices , but hasn ' t started a trading operation , spokesman will flower said . allied waste industries inc . , the second -

- if a person offered to double your money when a coin lands heads and take away half your money when it is tails , would you take the bet ? what if the person flipping the coin is a magician you don ' t trust ?  a wall street journal report wednesday speculated on enron ' s potential as an acquisition for a more stable company . an enron spokesman said the company doesn ' t comment on such matters . enron has been under pressure for more than two weeks , beginning when the energy merchant reported a $ 1 billion charge in its third - quarter earnings . a securities and exchange commission probe into two of the company ' s limited partnerships and a rating downgrade by moody ' s investors service haven ' t helped . john olson , an analyst at sanders morris harris , said he thought an enron takeover unlikely at this point .  however , if the stock were to keep coming down , and their financial difficulties were extended , the odds would increase ,  he said . olson pointed out that enron ' s heavy losses over the last 10 sessions partly reflects the end of the tax year for mutual funds . the calendar year for funds ends at the close of business wednesday .  mutual funds who own enron stock have been trying to offset other gains by selling off enron ,  he said .  mutual funds have to register all their gains or losses and offset them by selling or buying stock by the close today .  taking bets art smith , chairman and chief executive of the research firm john s . herold , said he ' d be surprised if enron was not entertaining offers .  it ' s one of the ways that enron gets the genie back in the bottle .  on the other hand , smith said , it would take a potential acquirer time to become comfortable with the valuation of the business .  it ' s doubtful that a potential acquirer can resolve all the valuation issues quickly ,  smith said . he said it ' s likely that any sort of purchase agreement would contain what he called a  look - back provision ,  which would protect the acquirer from being strapped to a fixed value . smith said he could see either general electric ' s ge capital or royal dutch shell making a bid . both were mentioned in the journal report .  ge capital is big enough that if it didn ' t work out it won ' t cripple ge , and they ' ve been opportunistic on things like this ,  smith said .  and shell always keeps us guessing .  olson also included aig and citigroup as potential acquirers .  enron has certainly had some appeal to people that are used to an aggressive trading culture ,  he said . smith said that even without enron , the energy marketing and trading business would continue to thrive .  even if enron went away , it would not change what has developed into a healthy market for commodity forward markets and hedging ,  he said . lisa sanders is a dallas -

- volatility and premiums on enron ' s near - month options remain extremely high . it is a sign that investors are willing to pay a rich price for option protection and expect the stock to be unsettled as the houston company sorts through its credit and debt problems and seeks to calm frazzled investors . enron near - month defensive puts traded heavily in an otherwise quiet session wednesday , as investors bought them to hedge . the december 5 puts traded more than 10 , 000 contracts and jumped 45 cents to $ 1 . 10 at the chicago board options exchange . the stock closed down $ 1 . 98 , or 28 % , to $ 5 . 01 , as of 4 p . m . in new york stock exchange composite trading . enron ' s calls traded actively as some investors sold them to generate income . traders noted some call buying - - especially after enron procured a three - week extension on a $ 690 million note - - as some hopeful investors bet on enron pulling through its troubles and proceeding with its merger with dynegy inc . enron ' s december 5 calls traded more than 14 , 500 contracts , compared with open interest of 710 , as they fell $ 1 . 45 to $ 1 . 15 at the cboe . for investors who want to book a tax loss on beaten - down stocks , the  wash sale  rule can be a hurdle , because it essentially prevents taxpayers from selling stock or securities at a loss and then reacquiring  substantially identical  securities within a 30 - day period before or after that loss . this poses a problem for those who want to book a loss yet own stocks whose prices now make them attractive  buy  candidates . in addition , the internal revenue service has taken the position that the wash - sale rule will disallow a loss if the investor sells an in - the - money put , because there is a strong likelihood that stock will be put to or acquired by the investor . so investors typically get around the wash - sale rule by  doubling up  : buying additional stock or options , waiting at least 31 days , and then selling the original stock to book the loss . investors double up by buying calls , which locks a price to buy stock and achieves the same effect as buying additional stock . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . dynegy deal to buy enron hits crossroads by rebecca smith and john r . emshwiller staff reporters of the wall street journal 11 / 23 / 2001 the wall street journal a 3 ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) even as it reiterated its intention to purchase enron corp . , dynegy inc . is coming under increasing pressure to renegotiate or walk away from the multibillion - dollar deal . the pressure is stemming from the continuing slide in the price of enron shares and the mounting financial problems at the houston energy - trading company , the nation ' s biggest marketer of electricity and natural gas . during the past month , enron has taken a $ 1 billion write - off of assets , revised downward the earnings of the past several years and taken a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity . the problems have been due largely to dealings enron had with private partnerships , run by some of its own executives , under investigation by the securities and exchange commission . in an sec filing monday , enron disclosed hundreds of millions of potential additional write - offs as well as the possibility that its weakening financial condition could force it to repay more than $ 2 billion in loans by the end of the year . as of 4 p . m . wednesday in new york stock exchange composite trading , enron shares fell $ 1 . 98 , or 28 % , to $ 5 . 01 each after having dropped 23 % tuesday . in excess of 115 million shares traded wednesday , more than four times the volume of any other big board stock . enron ' s bonds also again traded sharply lower , market observers said . the turmoil spilled over to dynegy ' s stock , which also was among the most actively traded on the new york stock exchange . as of 4 p . m . wednesday , dynegy shares fell $ 1 . 94 to $ 39 . 76 each . on wednesday , dynegy issued a statement in which chairman and chief executive chuck watson said his company was working  to accelerate the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger in accordance with the previously announced agreement  though it continued to perform  due diligence  on enron . under the merger agreement , dynegy has opportunities to renegotiate or walk away from the deal if enron ' s financial and legal problems become severe enough . however , some observers said it can be difficult to invoke these so - called material adverse change clauses . they point to a decision earlier this year by a delaware chancery court judge who forced tyson foods inc . to complete a planned purchase of ibp inc . even though tyson , a springdale , ark . , food - products company , had wanted to cancel the transaction because of a drop in ibp ' s earnings and accounting problems at an ibp unit . dynegy officials didn ' t return calls seeking comment . to complete the deal , two - thirds of dynegy shareholders and a majority of enron shareholders would have to give their approval . no dates for those votes have been set . one person familiar with the merger plans said the sec filing monday by enron contained information dynegy hadn ' t known about . dynegy representatives planned to work through the weekend evaluating the importance of this new information as part of the company ' s due diligence , this person said . it couldn ' t be determined what the new information was . the merger agreement , announced nov . 9 , calls for dynegy to exchange 0 . 2685 share for each of enron ' s roughly 850 million fully diluted shares , giving the purchase a value of about $ 9 billion at dynegy ' s current stock price . however , from a price standpoint , the deal is appearing less attractive to dynegy . on the day of the merger announcement , enron shares were trading at about $ 8 . 63 each , or about 83 % of the purchase price under the exchange ratio . as of wednesday , enron ' s market price was only about 47 % of the merger - formula price . such a sharp deterioration is unusual following a merger announcement , when the stock price of the company being acquired generally begins trading relatively close to the offering price . sentiment among wall street analysts also is turning against the merger . initially , many analysts lauded the merger as a move that would rescue enron and provide a major boost to houston - based dynegy . dynegy and enron officials have predicted that the merger , supposed to be completed late next year , would significantly and immediately increase dynegy ' s earnings . now analysts are challenging that assumption . ron barone , managing director at ubs warburg llc , said he believes that because of enron ' s financial problems , a combined company would actually have lower earnings next year than dynegy would have by itself . mr . barone said he thinks a  likely scenario  is that the merger formula will be renegotiated sharply down to about 0 . 15 dynegy share for each enron share . such a ratcheting down wouldn ' t be without precedent in the deal . according to one person familiar with the merger negotiations , dynegy reduced the exchange formula at least once prior to the nov . 9 announcement because of enron ' s rapidly sinking stock price , which at the beginning of this year was above $ 80 a share . in perhaps the most significant sign of the turning tide on wall street , goldman sachs analyst david fleischer lowered his ratings on enron and dynegy . a longtime enron fan , mr . fleischer issued a report expressing doubts that the merger would help dynegy ' s earnings and whether enron could  recover the significant business that has been lost  in its giant energy - trading operations .  the enron machine continues to sputter ,  mr . fleischer wrote . some observers say that if dynegy walked away from the deal or tried to renegotiate the terms significantly , enron might be pushed into a bankruptcy - law filing . without the dynegy acquisition and continued support from its bankers and customers , an enron bankruptcy - court filing  is highly possible ,  said ralph pellecchia , a senior director at fitch , a credit - ratings agency . on wednesday , fitch maintained its credit rating on enron at just one notch above noninvestment - grade , or  junk ,  status . but fitch also said it believed enron ' s trading partners had made  significant cash collateral calls  in recent days that are  well in excess of previous expectations ,  contributing to  liquidity pressures .  among the advisers enron has hired during its current crisis is the law firm of weil , gotshal & manges , which specializes in bankruptcy and corporate - workout situations . asked about a possible bankruptcy filing , an enron spokeswoman said the company expects the dynegy deal to go through and therefore doesn ' t expect to have to look at alternatives to the merger . since the merger announcement , enron chairman kenneth lay has said his company had alternatives to the dynegy deal but he has declined to identify them . enron said it made some progress improving its financial position . the company said it reached a final agreement with units of j . p . morgan chase & co . and citigroup inc . on the remaining $ 450 million of a previously announced $ 1 billion in secured credit lines . enron said lenders had agreed to extend repayment of an existing $ 690 million note to mid - december from next week . the spokeswoman said a restructuring of that obligation is expected to be completed next month so that repayment wouldn ' t be required this year . - - - thaddeus herrick and robin sidel contributed to this article . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron faces suits by 401 ( k ) plan participants by theo francis and ellen schultz staff reporters of the wall street journal 11 / 23 / 2001 the wall street journal cl ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) enron corp . , the embattled houston energy and trading company , has been sued by members of its employee - retirement plan , which has suffered losses because of enron ' s plummeting stock price . two separate lawsuits , filed in federal court in houston , allege enron misled participants in its 401 ( k ) retirement plan about the risks of investing in the company ' s shares and note that the company forced the employees to remain invested in its stock even as the shares fell . amid growing disclosures of financial problems in recent weeks , the company  locked down  the retirement plan from oct . 17 to nov . 19 to make administrative changes , which prevented employees from selling enron shares as the share price collapsed . enron , which recently agreed to be acquired by dynegy inc . , houston , because of mounting financial problems , has seen its stock price fall to $ 5 . 01 on wednesday from a peak of nearly $ 90 a share last year . the decline has been costly to participants in enron ' s retirement plan because more than 60 % of the 401 ( k ) assets were invested in enron shares at the end of last year , according to one of the suits . the first suit was filed nov . 13 on behalf of plan participants by campbell harrison & wright llp , a houston law firm , and the second was filed tuesday by seattle - based hagens berman llp . both seek class - action certification . enron said its corporate policy is not to comment on pending lawsuits . a spokeswoman also said the company ' s 401 ( k ) plan offers participants 18 investment choices , one of which is company stock . the company ' s stock has fallen amid mounting losses and disclosures that it had extensive off - balance - sheet dealings with a web of partnerships headed by former company officials . the securities and exchange commission has launched a formal investigation into the company ' s accounting , and enron has said it will restate years of financial information . the suits against enron are the latest of a series of suits filed against companies over losses in the company - stock portion of their 401 ( k ) plans . the suits allege the plan trustees breached their fiduciary duties by continuing to offer company stock , even after they became aware of serious business problems that would hurt the stock price . all the suits are pending . as with most of these companies , enron matches employee contributions to the 401 ( k ) with shares of enron stock , and also offers enron stock as an investment choice , in addition to a variety of mutual funds . about $ 1 . 3 billion of the plan ' s $ 2 . 1 billion in assets was invested in enron shares at the end of 2000 , according to the suit filed by campbell harrison . pamela tittle , a participant in the 401 ( k ) plan who worked in the finance department and a named plaintiff in the enron suit filed by campbell harrison & wright , had roughly 2 , 000 shares of enron stock in her retirement account and has suffered losses of about $ 140 , 000 as a result of the stock ' s decline . the suit alleges that the trustees of the enron 401 ( k ) plan violated their fiduciary duties by not informing plan participants that the company stock was in peril . the suit filed by hagens berman , also alleges that the company failed to warn participants about risks of remaining invested in enron stock . in addition , it accuses enron of systematically misrepresenting its financial results since 1998 in connection with the partnerships under investigation by the sec . roy e . rinard , a lineman for enron in oregon who is a named plaintiff in the suit filed by hagens berman , has seen the value of his retirement plan fall to $ 70 , 000 from $ 470 , 000 , largely as a result of the decline in enron ' s stock .  i feel like i have been betrayed ,  mr . rinard said in press release issued by his lawyers .  i lost my savings , my plans for the future , everything .  under federal pension law , companies are allowed to offer their own stock in retirement plans , and are allowed to force employees to hold onto the stock . enron doesn ' t let employees diversify out of shares they receive as matching contributions to the 401 ( k ) plan until age 50 . however , plan trustees are supposed to operate the plan in the best interests of the participants , which includes choosing prudent investments . generally , to prove that the plan ' s administrators breached their fiduciary duties , employees must show that the trustees knew the stock was a bad investment . this presents a high hurdle , so it is not surprising that prior lawsuits over losses in company stock in 401 ( k ) plans have generally come in the wake of allegations of accounting irregularities . lynn sarko , one of ms . tittle ' s attorneys with seattle ' s keller rohrback llp , is also co - lead counsel in a similar lawsuit against lucent technologies inc . , murray hill , n . j . another firm representing ms . tittle is dalton gotto samson & kilgard plc , which is lead counsel in a similar suit against ikon office solutions inc . , malvern , pa . the two law firms are representing ms . tittle with campbell harrison & wright . the suits against lucent and ikon , like the suit against enron , allege that then - current plan trustees kept offering company stock in the plan despite knowing of serious business problems that would hurt the stock price . representatives for ikon and lucent say their companies didn ' t require employees to invest in the company stock , and educated employees about the need for diversification . the suit in which mr . rinard is plaintiff notes that on oct . 17 , a day after enron announced the company was taking a nonrecurring charge totaling $ 1 . 01 billion in the third quarter , enron  locked down  the 401 ( k ) plan ' s assets , preventing participants from selling enron shares . ( a  lock - down  occurs when a retirement plan is transferred from one administrator to another , and generally lasts several weeks , during which time participants can ' t make changes in their investment choices ) . the lock - down was lifted on nov . 19 . in the interim , on nov . 8 , enron announced it would be forced to restate downward its reported financial results from 1997 through 2000 . by the time the lock - down was lifted , as a result of all the negative news the shares had fallen to below $ 9 a share from $ 32 . 20 on oct . 17 , when the lockup started , hagens berman attorney karl barth said .  they were locked into it right when enron knew it was going to be announcing some really bad news ,  mr . barth said .  mr . rinard ' s looking at having no retirement savings now . it ' s a horrible thing to have to start over in your 50 s .  copyright ? 2000 dow jones section c from sunbeam to enron , andersen ' s reputation suffers by floyd norris 11 / 23 / 2001 the new york times page 1 , column 2 c . 2001 new york times company this has been the worst year ever for arthur andersen , the accounting firm that once deserved the title of conscience of the industry . the securities and exchange commission filed civil fraud complaints against the andersen partner who audited sunbeam and against the firm itself in the waste management case . now enron has repudiated the financial statements that were certified by arthur andersen , in the process shaving more than half a billion dollars from the company ' s reported profits in recent years . all of which raises the question : has arthur andersen become the black sheep of the accounting industry ? it is not an easy question to answer , and not everyone is willing to rush to judgment . ' ' if you want to attack andersen for enron , you need to know more than we know , ' ' arthur levitt , the former chairman of the securities and exchange commission , said this week . but if there is a thread connecting what is known about the three cases , it is materiality . in all three cases , andersen auditors spotted bad accounting but were persuaded it was immaterial and therefore allowed it to go ahead . materiality is one of those flexible concepts that can get accountants into trouble . the idea is that it doesn ' t much matter if a few little things were gotten wrong . but they can add up . at enron , however , they did not add up to that much - - a total of $ 93 million over four years . the biggest restatement of enron profits concerns a related party that enron now says should have been consolidated . it is not clear if andersen had the facts needed to make that decision at the time . to those who treasure the role of auditors , the humiliation of andersen is painful . back in the 1950 ' s , it was leonard spacek , andersen ' s managing partner , who warned that ' ' the profession ' s existence is in peril ' ' because it was not showing enough independence . his public prodding was crucial in making the industry do a better job . two decades ago , when the issue on the table was pension accounting , andersen was the only major accounting firm to break with clients and push for good rules . now andersen ' s backbone is open to question . it was evidence that senior people at andersen repeatedly gave in to pressure from waste management that led the s . e . c . to bring that suit , which the firm chose to settle without admitting it had done anything wrong . the partner that the s . e . c . says looked the other way at sunbeam is fighting the accusations , and andersen says he acted properly . lynn turner , who was chief accountant of the s . e . c . at the time and is now director of the center for quality financial reporting at colorado state university , says what is happening to andersen now is reminiscent of what happened to coopers & lybrand when he was a partner there and the firm had a series of highly publicized blown audits . ' ' we got bludgeoned to death in the press , ' ' he said . ' ' people did not even want to see us at their doorsteps . it was brutal , but we deserved it . we had gotten into this mentality in the firm of making business judgment calls . ' ' by that he meant that the firm paid too much attention to not offending clients and not enough to good accounting . for andersen to avoid that fate , its relatively new chief executive , joseph berardino , who declined to be interviewed for this column , will need to set a tone inside the firm making clear that he expects auditors to show the backbone that mr . spacek epitomized . and then he will have to convince the public of that . copyright ? 2000 dow jones section c chase and j . p . morgan ' s paper anniversary a year after the merger , rosy plans meet reality by riva d . atlas 11 / 23 / 2001 the new york times page 1 , column 5 c . 2001 new york times company when william b . harrison jr . speaks of last year ' s $ 31 billion merger of j . p . morgan and the chase manhattan corporation , he speaks proudly of a deal that he considers to be a capstone to his 34 - year career of helping build a giant of the banking business . ' ' this is the first merger i ' ve been part of , ' ' said mr . harrison , the chief executive of the combined bank , ' ' where i feel our core business is complete . ' ' the chase - j . p . morgan combination helped advance the bank into the investment banking elite , just as mr . harrison intended . but with wall street and the economy in far different places today than they were when the deal was put together , the many mergers , stock sales and other money - making opportunities that were supposed to justify the high - priced acquisition have largely dried up for now . consequently , deal makers and analysts who follow the bank are already speculating that mr . harrison , 58 , may ultimately be compelled to do yet another large deal , this time to diversify his business away from its heavy emphasis on wall street . j . p . morgan chase has won some prominent assignments , like handling the revampings of troubled giants like lucent and , more recently , enron , the beleaguered energy trading company . but while j . p . morgan chase is proud of serving alongside citigroup as both lead lender and adviser to enron on its acquisition by dynegy , the dual role it has worked to achieve sometimes proves complicated for the bank . with enron ' s shares in free fall as more information comes out about its hidden debts , j . p . morgan chase has been scrambling to maintain the support of other banks while simultaneously keeping the merger with dynegy on track . thanks largely to the slump on wall street , j . p . morgan chase ' s profits fell by two - thirds in the third quarter , to $ 449 million from $ 1 . 4 billion in the period a year ago . its stock has dropped 15 percent this year , more than other banks ' shares . the bank ' s stock is ahead of investment banks like goldman sachs , with which j . p . morgan chase increasingly competes . ' ' the jury is still out in many respects on this merger , ' ' said judah kraushaar , an analyst at merrill lynch . nevertheless , he likes j . p . morgan chase ' s stock , he said , because ' ' expectations are very low . ' ' all j . p . morgan chase ' s competitors are suffering from the slowdown on wall street . but some , like citigroup , are better diversified and have greater involvement in old - fashioned consumer banking , which is proving to be a strong moneymaker this year . nearly a third of j . p . morgan chase ' s revenues are consumer - oriented . by contrast , its chief new york rival , citigroup , gets half its revenues from consumer businesses . ' ' the timing of the merger was bad , ' ' said steven wharton , a banking analyst at loomis , sayles donald h . layton , one of two leaders of investment banking ; and james b . lee jr . , the bank ' s senior deal maker . the team also includes dina dublon , the bank ' s chief financial officer . two other senior executives have also lived through big deals . geoffrey t . boisi , the other investment banking leader , was the one - time investment banking chief at goldman , sachs . david a . coulter , in charge of chase ' s retail bank , had been chief executive of bank of america before it was bought by nationsbank . ' ' there aren ' t many teams that have gone through as many mergers as bill harrison and his team , ' ' said mark g . solow , managing principal at garmark advisors , an investment firm , and a former senior executive at chemical . still , ms . dublon acknowledged that the tough economy was making the j . p . morgan takeover more difficult than the earlier combinations . ' ' in general , mergers are very hard on morale , ' ' she said . ' ' there is no question that this one has a tougher emotional toll . ' ' the bank ' s executives are making the best of a bad situation . they have taken advantage of the slowdown to cut around 8 percent of the combined banks ' staff , or about 2 , 500 more employees than anticipated at the time the merger was announced . many of these job cuts were aimed at high - cost investment bankers : j . p . morgan chase expects that 6 , 000 jobs in its investment banking division will have been eliminated by the end of the year . ' ' we have focused on the tougher jobs to cut , ' ' ms . dublon said . in some ways the overall market turmoil has made it easier for j . p . morgan chase to overhaul its staff . with fewer jobs available on wall street , mr . shapiro said , the employees who are left behind are less apt to complain about changes in their jobs . ' ' people have fewer options , ' ' he said , ' ' so you have a little more control over the process . ' ' thanks partly to these cuts , the bank estimates the saving from cost cutting will be $ 3 . 6 billion annually , compared with an original projection of $ 2 billion at the time of the merger . the cost cutting has helped compensate somewhat for a sharp drop in profits in the bank ' s core businesses . ' ' what we can control and are managing very aggressively is the expenses of the company , ' ' ms . dublon said in a conference call with reporters on oct . 17 , the day earnings were announced . aside from cost cuts , the weakness on wall street makes it hard for the bank ' s executives to point to tangible gains in investment banking , where fees were down 24 percent in the third quarter . but mr . harrison points to market - share gains the bank has achieved at the expense of competitors on wall street . he hopes that when the investment banking business revives , j . p . morgan chase will hold on to these gains . the bank is particularly proud of its standing in two areas : mergers and acquisitions , and the underwriting of large investment - grade bond deals . the bank ranked 5 th worldwide in the highly profitable category of advising on mergers during the first nine months of 2001 , up from chase ' s 12 th - place finish and j . p . morgan ' s 10 th - place standing during the same period last year , according to thomson financial securities data . the merger and acquisitions business , which chase had been slowly building for years , is stronger following the merger with j . p . morgan , said mr . lee , a vice chairman at the bank . as a result , the bank is able to win assignments providing advice to customers who dealt with the old chase only for loans . mr . lee remains proud of the bank ' s work with enron , the energy company , despite its troubles . j . p . morgan chase , along with citigroup , raised $ 1 billion in bank financing for enron earlier this month . it was also hired to advise the company , which hopes to be saved from collapse by being taken over by dynegy . the old chase , long a lending powerhouse , would have had a good shot at leading the bank financing , but an advisory role would have been less certain . mr . lee said the investment banker advising enron came from the old j . p . morgan . but with merger activity slow , there are few such deals to go around . the bank is also proud of its strength in long - term investment - grade bonds , another area that business executives say has been enhanced by the merger . it moved up to second place in that area so far this year , compared with sixth place a year ago . the bank has taken advantage of a boom in large corporate bond offerings , a surge driven by today ' s low interest rates . in may j . p . morgan chase raised $ 12 billion in bonds for worldcom , the telecommunications company , in the largest corporate debt deal in the united states on record . unfortunately for j . p . morgan chase , the fees for underwriting investment - grade debt are small compared with the money to be earned coordinating offerings of stock , where j . p . morgan chase remains a second - tier competitor . the bank actually lost market share in the rankings for underwriters of stock , falling to 9 th place this year , compared with the old j . p . morgan ' s 6 th - place finish a year ago . ( chase was 11 th . ) mr . harrison said the bank was taking advantage of the slowdown in stock offerings to build momentum slowly in that business . ' ' we think we have a chance in the second half of this year to be in the top five , ' ' he said . given the slowdown , some bankers predict that mr . harrison will ultimately do another deal , either to expand his consumer banking business or to bolster weak areas in investment banking , like the equity division . ' ' the general view is that the combination with j . p . morgan didn ' t do enough , ' ' one investment banker said . mr . harrison disagrees : ' ' i don ' t feel , ' ' he said , ' ' we need to do another large deal to be successful . ' ' photo : william b . harrison jr . , the chief executive , says he has no doubts about the wisdom of forming j . p . morgan chase , even though the the economy has slowed since then . ' ' i can ' t tell you how happy i am about having done this merger , ' ' he said .

emptive move to ensure liquidity - - - firm will pay debt , keep cash cushion by wall street journal staff reporters john r . emshwiller , rebecca smith and jathon sapsford 10 / 26 / 2001 the wall street journal cl ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) enron corp . drew down about $ 3 billion , the bulk of its available bank credit lines , in a bid to restore confidence in its financial strength and liquidity . enron will use part of the money to offer to redeem about $ 1 . 85 billion of outstanding commercial paper - - short - term corporate ious - - according to a person familiar with the matter , with the remainder providing the energy concern with a cash cushion . some observers believe the move is a pre - emptive step by enron to ensure that it had adequate liquidity should its access to bank lines be interrupted . the person also said enron was talking to its banks about a new , multibillion - dollar credit line . enron insists its business operation and financial condition remain strong . but ,  when the market is reacting as irrationally as it has been the last few days , we thought that cash was better than a commitment from a bank ,  said an enron spokesman . in a statement , the company ' s new chief financial officer , jeff mcmahon , said that by drawing down the bank lines ,  we are making it clear that enron has the support of its banks and more than adequate liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our commitments .  the move underscored the tumultuous conditions that have been sweeping over the houston energy - trading concern in the past 10 days . enron is the nation ' s largest energy trader and is a principal in nearly one - quarter of all electricity and natural - gas trades . yesterday , for example , enron was involved in about $ 4 billion of deals through its enrononline unit . since early last week , enron ' s share price has plummeted 50 % . last week , it reported a $ 618 million third - quarter loss and a reduction in shareholder equity of $ 1 . 2 billion . it also disclosed that the securities and exchange commission is conducting an inquiry into billions of dollars of transactions it did with entities connected to its former chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow , who was replaced wednesday . the draw - down of the credit facilities came as one rating agency , fitch , put enron on review for a possible downgrade , while another , standard it takes time to sell assets , particularly in today ' s slower economy . the company also is suffering from a string of disclosure controversies that have damaged its credibility , particularly in connection with its dealings with mr . fastow , the former chief financial officer . internal documents related to one of the fastow partnerships disclose that enron also did as much as hundreds of millions of dollars of business with an entity connected to another company official , who has since left enron . while enron disclosed its fastow - related transactions in sec filings , a computerized search of the sec ' s database of public filings produced no reference to this other employee - related entity known as chewco . chewco was established in 1997  with approximately $ 400 million in capital commitments  to buy an interest in enron assets , according to one of the partnerships documents . the document didn ' t further specify what assets were purchased , and it didn ' t disclose the financial impact of the transactions for either chewco or enron . chewco was being run by michael kopper , a managing director in enron ' s global equity markets group , according to the document . enron , which has maintained that its complex financial transactions with employee - related entities were legal and properly disclosed , didn ' t have any comment regarding its dealings with chewco . mr . kopper , who enron says left the company this year to focus on helping to run the fastow - related partnerships , didn ' t return phone calls . a person at his office in houston yesterday said mr . kopper was traveling . in response to questions about chewco , an enron spokesman would say only that  michael kopper was never an executive officer of enron .  mr . fastow repeatedly has declined interview requests . he severed his relationships with the partnerships in july . this statement is an apparent reference to sec disclosure regulations regarding related - party transactions . under sec rule s - k , a company has to report any transaction that exceeds $ 60 , 000 and involves  any director or executive officer .  by contrast , mr . fastow , as cfo , would have fallen into that category , but mr . kopper , as managing director of a business unit , presumably wouldn ' t have . however , reporting guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board seems to have a broader definition , one that might include mr . kopper . according to fas statement 57 , a related - party transaction involves a  material  piece of business between the company and a member of management . the statement defines management as directors , top officers , vice presidents in charge of major business units and  other persons who perform similar policy - making functions . persons without formal titles may also be members of management .  copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . deals & deal makers : enron officials sell shares amid stock -

trading company , cashed in shares for $ 25 . 7 million so far this year , usually in transactions paired with options exercises . he sold 429 , 614 shares , leaving him with some 2 . 8 million shares as of july , the latest data available on his sales , according to thomson financial / lancer analytics . the dollar amount for his 2001 sales is approaching the total for all mr . lay ' s sales of enron shares for 2000 , which reached $ 30 . 7 million . in 1999 , he sold shares for a total of $ 26 million . in houston , an enron spokeswoman declined to comment on the figures , saying the company doesn ' t keep a running tally of stockholdings by corporate officials . enron also wouldn ' t comment on the number of options held by company insiders and called the sales  a personal decision .  many sales by enron insiders were concurrent with options exercises or sales followed soon after option exercises . strong selling by company officers and directors amid share - price declines should raise red flags for investors , says jonathan moreland , research director of insiderinsights . com , who uses insider - trading data to zero in on investment ideas . among other insiders selling during the year , kenneth rice , former chairman and ceo of enron ' s broadband unit , sold shares for $ 23 . 7 million . mr . rice has sold 456 , 966 shares of the 1 . 5 million shares he was listed as owning in enron ' s march proxy filing . former enron chief executive jeffrey skilling - - who resigned in august - - sold 160 , 000 shares for $ 9 . 8 million during the year . in march , mr . skilling owned 1 . 9 million shares . messrs . rice and skilling couldn ' t be reached to comment . overall , enron ' s insiders were busier selling shares last year , when they sold 5 . 8 million shares for about $ 449 million . during 1999 , insiders sold 3 . 4 million shares for $ 123 . 1 million . since december 1999 , only one enron executive has reported buying company shares . the buyer was andrew fastow , who was ousted during the week as enron ' s chief financial officer after the company disclosed it was under a securities and exchange commission investigation into financial ties between the company and mr . fastow . mr . fastow reported purchasing 10 , 000 enron shares in august at $ 36 . 98 each , or a total of $ 369 , 800 . today , those shares are valued at $ 163 , 500 , based on enron ' s stock price of $ 16 . 35 in 4 p . m . new york stock exchange composite trading . after the purchase , mr . fastow owned 110 , 586 shares , thomson financial / lancer analytics says . enron said mr . fastow wasn ' t available to comment . on monday , a new york law firm filed suit in u . s . district court in houston , alleging that enron misrepresented its performance by failing to disclose problems with its broadband division and failing to properly write down the value of investments in limited partnerships managed by mr . fastow . the suit , which seeks class - action status , also says enron insiders sold $ 73 million of their own enron holdings during parts of 2000 and 2001 . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . credit markets enron ' s financial troubles reverberate to bonds with poor liquidity and credit - rating concerns by jathon sapsford and suzanne mcgee staff reporters of the wall street journal 10 / 26 / 2001 the wall street journal cl 5 ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) new york - - enron corp . ' s bonds have held up better than its battered stock amid escalating financial woes at the energy - trading powerhouse . not for long , some bond traders say . in trading yesterday , the houston company ' s five - year bond , a $ 250 million issue due in july 2006 carrying a coupon of 6 . 4 % , was quoted at 82 cents on the dollar , down from a bid of 88 late wednesday , and representing a 16 % drop during the past two weeks . that is far less than the 50 % decline in enron ' s stock price since the oct . 16 disclosure of a $ 1 . 01 billion charge linked to soured investments , resulting in a $ 618 million third - quarter loss . but the fall in the bond ' s price translates to a yield of 7 . 7 percentage points above bellwether u . s . government bonds , which is a widening from about three percentage points two weeks ago . although enron still is an investment - grade credit , that kind of  spread  is more characteristic of a junk bond with a credit rating of single b or lower . enron sought to assure the markets that its finances were sound , disclosing late yesterday that it drew down more than $ 1 billion on its bank credit lines to shore up its finances . yet even as enron was tapping its lifeline , investors were finding it difficult to trade big blocks of enron bonds . yesterday ' s 82 bid , for instance , was for a block of less than $ 2 million in bonds , a small percentage of a typical trade . fueling the uncertainty surrounding enron were fears that credit - rating concerns will lower ratings on enron debt after it recently conceded a slew of troubles , including losses , a securities and exchange commission investigation , and the sudden resignation of its chief financial officer .  even at these levels , there ' s very little buying interest ,  said harold rivkin , a principal at distressed - debt trader h . rivkin & co . in princeton , n . j . in one sign of the ripple effects , the price investors pay to protect themselves from losses on enron debt was surging . the cost of a  default swap  - - in which an investor pays another investor to take a chunk of debt at face value in the event of default - - rose to 10 % of the size of the credit being insured . that was up from 8 % a day earlier , and more than holders of lucent technologies inc . debt had to pay at the height of that technology company ' s troubles earlier during the year . even with its woes , enron remains an investment - grade company . most credit - rating agencies rate enron ' s senior unsecured debt at several notches above the noninvestment - grade level . yet fitch said yesterday it put enron ' s credit rating on watch for a possible downgrade , following a similar move by moody ' s investors service last week . ( standard & poor ' s , a division of mcgraw hill cos . , stopped short of putting the company on its creditwatch list , opting instead to revise its long - term ratings outlook to  negative ,  citing concerns about the company ' s financial flexibility . ) meanwhile , the weak bond prices are a sign that the markets are bracing for the worst .  these are investment - grade bonds that are migrating toward distressed levels ,  said glenn reynolds , an analyst at credit sights inc . , an independent fixed - income research firm in new york .  they aren ' t distressed yet , but they are headed in that direction .  if enron ' s credit ratings fall , it would have implications far beyond the company ' s ability to raise money . for an energy trader , a credit downgrade sends a signal to other participants in crucial markets about its ability to make good on its commitments . enron makes markets in a variety of commodities . though it is best known for trading electricity and natural gas , the company also is a huge force in the markets for other commodities such as lumber , metals , bandwidth capacity and steel . as a market maker matching buyers and sellers , enron handles about a quarter of all the trading in the nation ' s energy and gas markets . enron ' s credit - worthiness is hugely important . the better its credit rating , the cheaper it can hedge , or offset , its positions in all these commodities markets through derivatives and pass on savings to customers . without that credit rating , the cost of this high - margin , high - volume business starts to rise . a derivative is an instrument whose value is linked to , or derived from , that of an underlying security or asset , such as a stock , bond or commodity .  even if the company does retain its investment - grade rating , the perception that this might be at risk will start to affect their core businesses ,  said mr . reynolds at credit sights inc .  any prudent risk [ manager ] at enron ' s counterparties  - - any institution on the other end of a financial agreement with enron - -  is going to be examining their exposure to enron , and looking for ways to minimize it or offset it ,  mr . reynolds said . to be sure , enron , despite its recent woes , remains a strong company , credit analysts said .  i don ' t think anyone ' s seriously thinking that this is a company that would ever default ,  mr . reynolds said .  so far , our research shows that their counterparties and their banks are sticking with them ,  said ron barone , managing director of standard & poor ' s utility energy project finance group .  no one has cut credit lines or asked for additional collateral that we have identified . and customers have publicly stated that it ' s business as usual .  yet analysts say the arrival of distressed - debt traders on the scene could make life more difficult for enron and its management . traders expect enron ' s new chief financial officer jeffrey mcmahon and chairman kenneth lay to make the rounds of wall street next week , meeting with rating agencies , debt - trading desks , big bond holders and banks , including j . p . morgan chase & co . and citigroup inc . treasurys treasurys rallied on optimism that the federal reserve may cut interest rates more than previously expected after a spate of economic reports that documented how weak the economy was after the sept . 11 terrorist attacks . prices also gained as the market finished digesting the week ' s flood of treasury , corporate and agency debt issues . at 4 p . m . edt , the benchmark 10 - year treasury note was up 13 / 32 point , or $ 4 . 0625 per $ 1 , 000 face value , at 103 20 / 32 . its yield fell to 4 . 537 % from 4 . 588 % wednesday , as yields move inversely to prices . the 30 - year treasury bond ' s price was up 22 / 32 point at 101 11 / 32 to yield 5 . 284 % , down from 5 . 330 % wednesday . fed policy makers are slated to meet on nov . 6 . also providing support for longer maturities , the treasury department made another repurchase of issues outstanding . it received offers for $ 5 . 04 billion in callable 30 - year bonds , of which it accepted $ 1 billion . the offer - to - cover ratio , an indication of demand , was 5 . 04 . treasury buyback par par high wtd avg coupon mat amt amt accept accept % date offer accept price price 7 . 125 02 / 23 807 0 n / a n / a 11 . 750 02 / 10 235 0 n / a n / a 10 . 000 05 / 10 490 0 n / a n / a 12 . 750 11 / 10 471 0 n / a n / a 13 . 875 05 / 11 104 0 n / a n / a 14 . 000 11 / 11 203 0 n / a n / a 10 . 375 11 / 12 587 0 n / a n / a 12 . 000 08 / 13 974 0 n / a n / a 13 . 250 05 / 14 473 0 n / a n / a 12 . 500 08 / 14 725 39 3152 . 20 152 . 19 11 . 750 11 / 14 7826 0 7148 . 25 148 . 13 amounts in millions , prices in decimals . * amount outstanding after operation . calculated using amounts reported on announcement . corporate bonds motorola inc .

hardly . goldman on wednesday did bump enron off its  u . s . select list ,  which consists of a few dozen top stock picks - - but mr . fleischer continued to keep the stock on the firm ' s larger but prestigious  recommended list  of 200 or so favored stocks , where it has been since he joined goldman in 1993 .  just because i can ' t be specific in being able to create a simple model . . . doesn ' t mean that you write off that industry and say ` i can ' t analyze it ' or ` i can ' t figure it out , '  says mr . fleischer , who owns an undisclosed number of enron shares .  if that were the case , there would be an awful lot of industries we couldn ' t follow .  enron ' s shares have dropped about 50 % since last week .  every sell - side analyst we spoke to early in 2001 admitted that this was a black box ,  says jim chanos , principal of kynikos associates in new york , who has been selling enron stock short - - trading it with an eye to profiting from its fall - - throughout this year .  it was really a trust - me story , when all the evidence was mounting that there was reason to question that level of trust .  true , no stock picker is immune from bad calls . and wall street analysts long have been criticized for their overwhelmingly bullish bias , particularly on stocks in hot sectors with lots of investment - banking deals to be had . but enron stands apart , precisely because so many of the analysts still recommending the stock have acknowledged that the company ' s disclosure practices are lacking . which raises the question : how can an analyst recommend that others purchase a stock when key information about the company ' s operations is so often either unavailable or indecipherable ? concerns about the way that enron runs its business aren ' t new . many of the issues now plaguing enron ' s stock were first raised more than a year ago by bearish hedge - fund managers and independent accounting experts . yet time and again , wall street analysts dismissed as unimportant many of the lingering questions about the company ' s various partnership transactions . besides those partnerships , enron also has been dogged by concerns about the secretive valuation techniques it uses to record its assets and earnings . through it all , most analysts have stuck by this onetime stock - market darling , publicly dismissing questions about the firm ' s accounting practices and level of disclosure . as of yesterday , of the 17 analysts who following the stock , 10 had a  strong buy  or equivalent rating on the stock , according to thomson financial / first call . five others rated the stock a  buy ,  though not strongly . only prudential securities , which downgraded the stock this week , has a  sell  rating on enron . the bullish treatment is the latest and one of the most high - profile examples of wall street taking a glass half - full stance , despite what in retrospect seems to be ample warning that a less - enthusiastic approach was warranted . over the past year in the wake of the nasdaq composite index ' s general collapse , analysts have been widely assailed for a lack of independence - - particularly those who , like goldman ' s mr . fleischer , own shares in the companies they cover . regulators have raised concerns that analysts have compromised themselves to help their firms land lucrative investment - banking fees and other revenue . enron has spread the wealth across many wall street firms . for instance , for one $ 865 million equity offering in 1999 led by ` credit suisse first boston , enron retained seven co - managers , including donaldson lufkin & jenrette , lehman brothers and merrill lynch .  enron is a big company , and i don ' t think you ' re going to find a firm that hasn ' t been involved ,  says credit suisse first boston analyst curt launer , who still rates the stock a  strong buy  with a $ 40 price target .  they pay a lot of investment - banking fees to wall street .  he adds ,  we do our analysis every day based on the information we have . are we here strictly to defend companies ? that ' s ludicrous . we ' re here to provide information to investors . . . . yes , i have the wrong recommendation on the stock . i don ' t think my analysis has been as wrong as the stock has performed .  mr . fleischer , whose firm also has served as an investment banker to enron , calls his holding  a meaningful investment  that is  not small .  but he disputes any suggestion that his objectivity is compromised . mr . fleischer says his clients  are happy to know  he has a stake in enron , because it shows he puts his money where his mouth is . in his research note wednesday , mr . fleischer called for complete disclosures of enron ' s off - balance sheet partnerships . despite the resulting difficulty he acknowledged facing in developing financial models for the company , he wrote that he and many other investors historically  have given enron the benefit of doubt because of its strong growth in earnings  and position as an industry leader .  there ' s not information to really model this and be able to predict accurately where revenues are going to come from and where they ' re going to make their money , but every quarter they do ,  he says .  it ' s hard to get inside to know all the transactions , but they do deliver .  csfb ' s mr . launer also has been a longtime defender of the company , occasionally issuing research reports to rebut critical stories about enron in the financial press . on monday , he wrote that he expects questions about enron ' s partnerships and accounting disclosures to continue , but that he remains  confident in the businesses and operating growth prospects for [ enron ] and an ultimate recovery in the share price .   i know i ' m wrong on the stock ,  mr . launer says . but he says that at these prices , he isn ' t ready to throw in the towel because he figures that even in a worst - case scenario - - under which he envisions enron having to issue as much as $ 2 billion worth of shares , diluting current holders - - the stock doesn ' t have much further to fall . clearly , messrs . launer and flesicher aren ' t alone .  even in relative terms , analysts remain very bullish on this stock ,  says chuck hill , director of research at thomson financial / first call . the average rating for a stock on wall street is 2 . 2 , or slightly shy of a  buy  rating . enron scores a 1 . 6 .  this may turn into a classic case of locking the barn door after the bad news is out ,  mr . hill says . in downgrading the stock this week , prudential analyst carol coale bumped it to  sell  from  buy ,  with a brief stop at  hold .  while she is the only analyst to recommend investors sell the stock , she openly concedes her recent downgrades come  too little , too late .  ms . coale says enron has been difficult to cover for years . she says the company ' s disclosure practices fall far short of ideal , and senior executives are often evasive , even when presented with direct questions . for instance , she says three weeks ago she asked enron management if the company was under investigation by the securities and exchange commission . they said  no ,  she says . in light of the company ' s acknowledgment this week of an sec  inquiry ,  she asked enron about the previous denial .  they told me it is an inquiry , not an investigation ,  she says . an enron spokeswoman says the company learned of the sec ' s inquiry only last wednesday . copyright ?

' arbs ' sit out possible dynergy - enron deal , for now by janet whitman of dow jones newswires 11 / 09 / 2001 dow jones news service ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) new york - ( dow jones ) - it ' s been a brutal year in the risk arbitrage business , and that has many arbitrageurs , also known as takeover traders , steering clear of bets on dynergy inc . ' s ( dyn ) possible takeover of enron corp . ( ene ) . some of their reluctance stems from the fact that the looming deal reported by dow jones newswires has yet to be confirmed by the two houston energy trading companies . more worrisome , however , is the possibility that enron - already crippled by an equity probe and a restatement of four years of earnings - may have even deeper woes to report .  unless enron is providing significantly more disclosure to the buyer than to the rest of the world , i don ' t see how a buyer could get comfortable .  said an arbitrageur with a new york hedge fund . what worries takeover traders is the likelihood that any agreement would likely have extensive material adverse change , or mac , clauses , providing plenty of room for dynergy to exit the deal should more problems arise at enron .  as an investor , it ' s hard for me to own something when i don ' t know what it is ,  said the arbitrageur of enron .  i take some comfort that someone is stepping up the plate , but that ' s not enough for me .  another arbitrageur added ,  if it gets announced , it ' s a deal with a lot of issues , starting with who bears the risk if enron has a lot of lawsuits because of alleged accounting fraud .  according to the wall street journal , dynergy will swap nearly 0 . 27 of a share of its stock for each share of enron . also under the deal , chevrontexaco corp . ( cvx ) , which owns 26 % of dynergy , will make an immediate cash injection of $ 1 . 5 billion into the deal , and then add another billion on closing . shares of dynergy jumped more than 10 % in heavy trading , bolstered by the idea that the company is picking up enron for a steal . its shares traded recently at $ 39 . 61 , up $ 3 . 06 a share . an acquirer ' s shares typically fall after a deal has been announced , in part because arbitrageurs sell the shares short , while going long the target . in this case , however , arbitrageurs are largely on the sidelines , which is perhaps alleviating some of the downside pressure on dynergy . enron , meanwhile , traded about 4 % higher recently , swapping hands at $ 8 . 77 a share in heavy volume . the stock was buoyed by the reported bid from dynergy as well as a new credit rating from moody ' s . the firm downgraded enron ' s rating a notch to just above speculative , not as bad as the junk rating some had feared . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . power points : does dynegy know what it ' s getting into ? by mark golden 11 / 09 / 2001 dow jones energy service ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones 201 -

enron corp . , on the verge of a bailout by rival dynegy inc . , on friday had its credit ratings cut to a notch above junk status and some energy traders became increasingly leery of dealing with the company . moody ' s investors service cut enron ' s long - and short - term ratings , affecting about $ 13 billion in debt , and warned the company ' s rating could be cut again to junk status on continued loss of investor confidence , impairing its ability to operate . a significant amount of debt coming due in the near term , and the potential for increased margin requirements from its counterparties in wholesale trading operation also puts further pressure on enron , the ratings agency said .  the company may not be able to retain investment - grade characteristics ,  moody ' s said . enron ' s trading partners began to cast a more watchful eye on their relationship with their energy trading behemoth , which has seen almost $ 19 billion slashed from its market worth in the past month on mounting investor concerns .  our people are definitely looking at our dealings with enron after the downgrade . . . we need to make sure our bills will be paid ,  one texas - based spot trader said , adding his company was still conducting business with enron . the stock , which has plummeted 89 percent this year , moved into the black on friday after enron confirmed talks regarding the acquisition of enron by dynegy are continuing . an announcement , which is expected later friday , is expected to include a $ 1 . 5 billion injection of capital for enron from chevrontexaco corp . , the no . 2 u . s . oil company , and 26 . 5 percent holder of dynegy . shares of enron rose 40 cents , or 4 . 8 percent , to $ 8 . 81 in afternoon trade on the new york stock exchange , and dynegy gained $ 2 . 92 , or 8 percent , to $ 39 . 42 . the stock was the most actively traded on the nyse . restated results in recent weeks enron ' s stock has plunged amid investor unease about disclosures of off - balance sheet deals involving its former chief financial officer . the deals are now under investigation by the securities and exchange commission for possible conflict of interest .  people just don ' t want to deal with them anymore ,  said one trader , who heads the trading desk of one of the world ' s largest oil companies . on thursday , enron acknowledged it erred on past earnings reports and restated financial results going back to 1997 . the restated earnings cut net income by $ 591 million over the period , or 22 percent , and increased its debt by $ 628 million , pulling some of its partnerships onto the balance sheet . enron also fired its treasurer and a general counsel of one of its divisions on thursday . until now , enron ' s trading operations appeared relatively sheltered from its financial troubles , especially in the daily markets contracts . trading volumes on enrononline , the leading internet - based trading system for electricity , actually increased over the rolling 30 - day period . at the beginning of the week , enrononline dollar volumes averaged between $ 2 . 6 billion and $ 2 . 8 billion , compared with a 30 - day rolling average of $ 2 . 6 billion , according to eric thode , a spokesman for enrononline . the number of transactions posted on the site averaged over 6 , 500 on monday , well above the 5 , 800 average for the past 30 days . trading under pressure but friday , trading volume appeared to wane slightly , according to one industry watcher  i ' ve been watching the enron board all morning and it hardly lit up at all ,  said one trader in the u . s . northeast . the board lights up each time a transaction is made for delivery to a particular point . the hardest hit of enron ' s energy trading operations appear to be natural gas trades and both natural gas and electricity forward contracts , which are trades for delivery from one month to five years ahead .  starting today we are no longer doing forward deals with enron on the gas side . we are still doing day - ahead deals though ,  one southeast dealer said . he added he was unsure if his company was still trading forwards , or long - term deals , on the electricity side .  people are becoming much more cautious about entering into long - term energy deals with enron , especially the one - to five - year delivery contract for gas or electricity ,  said one major midwestern power trader . while many major traders watch online volumes and transactions , many bypass the system and make their deals over the telephone directly with enron . earlier this week . major natural gas producer apache corp . said it unwound most of its natural gas hedges due to concerns about increasing risks in the energy derivatives market as a result of enron ' s recent problems . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . usa : u . s . stocks crawl higher but profit warnings weigh . by elizabeth lazarowitz 11 / 09 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . new york , nov 9 ( reuters ) -

based energy trading and power company , was attempting to strike a deal yesterday evening to buy enron corp . , its beleaguered hometown rival , for roughly $ 7 billion to $ 8 billion in stock , one - tenth of what enron was worth 15 months ago . because any merger of the two would likely be scrutinized for many months and enron needs to shore up its beleaguered finances now , dynegy also is expected to inject an additional $ 1 . 5 billion into enron immediately , people familiar with the matter said . chevrontexaco corp . , which owns a 26 % stake in dynegy , is expected to provide dynegy with the funds for the cash infusion and is playing a significant role in the negotiations . chevrontexaco then will inject an additional $ 1 billion into the combined company once the deal is concluded so that its stake in dynegy isn ' t substantially reduced and so the combined company has a healthy balance sheet . with enron in a weak bargaining position , dynegy , which is one - fifth enron ' s size , was hoping to clinch a deal which would have it paying little , if any , premium for enron . the boards of dynegy , chevron and enron were meeting yesterday to discuss a potential deal , but a seesawing enron stock price and the complexity of a transaction yet could derail a deal , people familiar with the matter warned .  this is far from over ,  said one person familiar with the negotiations . several important points , including the exchange ratio , were still being worked out . dynegy expects to argue that enron shareholders will benefit from the upside of combining the two companies and that a transaction will add to dynegy ' s earnings because of potential synergies . spokesmen from enron and dynegy declined to comment . if approved by regulators , the deal would be a stunning development for enron , which transformed itself from a staid natural - gas - pipeline company into a highflying power - trading giant only to see its share price - - and hefty market valuation - - plummet in a matter of weeks . and for enron to sell itself for a low price is sure to stun investors . under the terms being worked out last night , enron chairman kenneth lay would have a seat on the combined company ' s board , but wouldn ' t hold any formal management position , said the people familiar with the matter . mr . lay may take on a consulting role . meanwhile , chuck watson , chairman and chief executive of dynegy , would be ceo of the combined company , while his no . 2 , stephen bergstrom , will president . enron has been scrambling for days to line up quick financing from a prominent outside investor and has been in discussions with private - equity firms and power - trading companies . the company desperately needs to win back its credibility on wall street following the disclosure that the securities and exchange commission was investigating the partnerships created to serve as a hedge against fluctuating market conditions . discussions between dynegy and enron began about 10 days ago , but intensified last weekend . enron also is expected today to disclose more financial dealings about the partnerships . a person close to dynegy said the potential acquirer feels it understands enron ' s business and is apprised of the liabilities , which have been factored into the transaction . should enron strike a deal , it hopes to stabilize its stock price . enron fell 6 . 4 % , or 62 cents , to $ 9 . 05 at 4 p . m . composite trading on the new york stock exchange . at one point yesterday morning , enron ' s stock had fallen 25 % on news reports that enron ' s efforts to line up investors had failed . the stock recovered after cnbc and dow jones newswires reported the talks with dynegy . the shares are at a new 52 - week low and far from the 52 - week high of $ 84 . 88 . dynegy fell $ 3 , or 8 . 3 % , to $ 33 , at 4 p . m . in big board trading . however , some investors believed the company ' s share price could benefit from the deal . jason selch , an energy analyst at wanger asset management in chicago , a large dynegy shareholder , said the company has a history of pulling off complicated deals and added that because enron is in such bad shape , dynegy could dictate the terms of the deal , shielding itself from potential losses due to shareholder lawsuits or problems with enron ' s complicated off - balance sheet dealings .  if they make an offer , they will be making an offer in order to get a steal ,  said mr . selch , who says enron ' s core energy - trading business is being valued at about half the normal market valuation of these operations .  i think they will be acquiring a business that will launch them into the no . 1 market - share position in energy trading ,  mr . selch added . whether a deal with dynegy materializes , the fact that enron is willing to consider a sale shows how its fortunes have sagged and underscores how desperate it is for a savior . the company , which was at the pinnacle of its success just a year earlier , boasted a market capitalization of $ 71 billion about a year ago and is now valued at about $ 7 billion . in exchange for the immediate capital infusion , dynegy is expected to get convertible preferred stock . in that type of deal , an investor receives a safe , bondlike interest payment and then can convert that holding into common stock after the share price rises to a specified level . enron also had been soliciting interest from private equity firms , but any discussions with those parties were proceeding on a slower track . people familiar with the negotiations said it was possible the financial players could still play some sort of role in any enron transaction , although details weren ' t immediately available . buyout firms clayton , dubilier & rice and blackstone group , which had been approached by enron to make an investment , decided against doing so , according to people familiar with the matter . indeed , enron ' s move to publicly disclose new information about the partnerships could provide intriguing details to any other potential bidders who are interested in a deal , but were reluctant to pursue enron without knowing more about those transactions . and because dynegy may only be paying a small premium , another suitor may be able to step up to the plate . the deal , if agreed to , will add to dynegy ' s earnings in the first year . the new entity will focus on the core business of north american and european wholesale , commercial and industrial energy markets and will capitalize on the opportunities generated by the combined , diversified asset - backed network supported by the strongest intellectual capital in the industry . aside from restoring confidence among its investors , enron has faced growing pressure from its trading partners . the company is offering special protections to some trading partners , hoping to prevent a mass exodus due to fears it could face further credit downgrades or wind up seeking the protection of a federal bankruptcy court . the protection takes the form of a  netting agreement  that permits a trading partner to offset the sums it is owed by various enron entities against the amounts that it owes the enron concerns . without such an arrangement , a company might owe money to one enron entity but have to stand in a long , slow line to collect sums owed by a different enron concern should the company seek bankruptcy - court protection . with netting , positions could cancel each other out , at least to some extent , and reduce a firm ' s ultimate credit exposure . enron spokesman mark palmer said the company has plenty of cash and has no need or intention of seeking protection from creditors , with whom it is current . -

mighty energy - trading company laid low by a financial crisis and government investigation , executives close to the transaction said . a deal would enable dynegy to buy the much bigger enron at a fire - sale price - - about $ 8 billion in stock , or roughly $ 10 a share , for a company that less than a year ago had a market value of nearly $ 70 billion . but with stock and bond investors fleeing , some of its trading partners refusing to do business with it , enron had few choices but to talk to dynegy . as part of the deal , chevron texaco , which owns a 27 percent stake in dynegy , would give enron a cash infusion of at least $ 1 . 5 billion up front and an additional $ 1 billion when the deal closed . the executives said the companies hope to finalize the details and announce the deal today . if completed , a takeover by dynegy , a company only about one - quarter its size in revenue , would represent a remarkable humbling of enron , the nation ' s biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity . enron had $ 139 . 7 billion in revenue for the first nine months of the year . as recently as last spring enron was lionized by investors as an innovator that had in many ways created and cleverly dominated the nation ' s deregulated energy markets . it would also vindicate not only dynegy , which took a more measured approach to doing business in those markets , but also critics uncomfortable with energy deregulation who said enron ' s energy trading was ruthless , its finances murky and its power and influence too extensive . the company ' s chairman and chief executive , kenneth l . lay , is a close friend of president bush . he has been one of mr . bush ' s largest campaign contributors , and no other energy company gave more money to republican causes last year than enron . mr . lay would be on the board of the combined companies , the executives said , but it was unclear if he would have an operational role . enron ' s problems came to light last month when the company disclosed $ 1 billion in write - downs and an unusual $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity . the reduction in equity arose from transactions with investment partnerships involving andrew fastow , the chief financial officer , who was forced to resign on oct . 24 . the securities and exchange commission is investigating those transactions . enron is expected today to send the s . e . c . answers to questions the agency has posed in its investigation . the answers have been reviewed by dynegy officials , the executives said , and are expected to be released publicly . enron is scheduled to meet its creditors tomorrow about the company ' s continuing crisis - - and about the merger deal , if there is one . people close to the deal say the company hopes that a deal with dynegy , and the release of the answers to the s . e . c . , will calm the crisis that has engulfed the company and led other energy companies that trade with enron to curtail their credit exposure to the company . besides worries about the huge losses and the s . e . c . investigation , investors and creditors are nervously watching enron ' s credit rating . moody ' s investors service and standard and poor ' s have already cut the rating to two notches above junk status , and on monday , fitch inc . cut it to one notch above junk . as part of the acquisition , dynegy would be taking on enron ' s $ 12 . 8 billion debt load - - a number that does not include billions of dollars of other debt , accumulated off the balance sheet , that has played a major role in enron ' s current problems . the executives said they expected the deal would lead to the sale of some enron assets to pay down the $ 12 . 8 billion debt . should enron lose its investment grade rating , other energy trading companies could curtail their business with the company even further , and enron could be forced to issue tens of millions of shares of stock to cover off - balance sheet debts that it has guaranteed . early wednesday , shares of enron plunged 28 percent , to about $ 7 , on fears that the company was unable to line up new investors . but the stock took back most of its losses in the afternoon after cnbc reported the talks with dynegy . shares of enron closed at $ 9 . 05 , off 62 cents . dynegy shares closed at $ 33 , down $ 3 . in addition to both companies ' very large presence in energy trading , enron owns the portland general electric company , a utility in oregon it had already agreed to sell , and dynegy owns the illinova corporation , a retail electricity and natural gas utility in illinois . regulators may take a hard look at those utilities in reviewing a merger deal , said jeff dietert , an analyst with simmons & company in houston . ' ' then you ' ve got concerns about market power , ' ' he said . ' ' it ' s just a lot of different issues to deal with before we get too excited that this deal is going to get done . ' ' the acquisition would combine enron , which dominates united states trading of electricity and natural gas and has been shedding its hard assets , with dynegy , a company that has pursued a much different strategy of using trading to maximize earnings from its power plants . enron has always concentrated on sophisticated financial trading strategies , a senior executive at a rival energy - trading firm , said . ' ' dynegy has always been more of a logistical player of physical assets , ' ' he said . ' ' those are very different cultures and very different mentalities . ' ' the executive noted that there had been an immense talent drain from enron in the last two weeks . ' ' it has become a frenzy , ' ' he said . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . trading places : fancy finances were key to enron ' s success , and now to its distress - - - impenetrable deals have put firm in position where it may lose independence - - - talks with rival dynegy by rebecca smith and john r . emshwiller staff reporters of the wall street journal 11 / 08 / 2001 the wall street journal al ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) when enron corp . convened its annual conference with credit analysts and bond investors in houston last february , the energy - trading giant was soaring and looking to climb higher . the company ' s stock was trading at about $ 80 a share , giving it a stock market value of $ 70 billion . though up fourfold from three years earlier , the stock price wasn ' t nearly high enough , enron ' s new chief executive , jeffrey skilling , told the audience . with its dominant position in energy - trading markets and its highly touted new moves into telecommunications , enron stock should be at $ 126 a share , mr . skilling argued . all in all , a vintage performance for a company not known for being bashful .  a lot of hype . a lot of spin ,  recalls todd shipman , a standard & poor ' s analyst who attended the conference .  that was enron .  yesterday , enron stock closed at $ 9 . 05 in new york stock exchange trading . mr . skilling is no longer around to promote the stock . in august , he unexpectedly resigned as chief executive after only six months in the top job . chief financial officer andrew fastow was replaced last month as controversy escalated over his role in running private partnerships involved in billions of dollars of transactions with enron . kenneth lay , enron ' s chief executive , has had to give up retirement plans to return to the helm . lately , the company has been offering special credit protection to increasingly nervous trading partners , including reliant energy inc . and entergy corp . the goal : to provide assurance that enron is a creditworthy partner and to prevent an exodus of customers . enron ' s trading operation generates 90 % of the company ' s profits . it looked yesterday as if the endgame might be beginning . mr . lay and enron ' s board were discussing a possible acquisition of enron by its much - smaller hometown energy - trading rival , dynegy inc . , in a stock swap valued at $ 7 billion to $ 8 billion . ( see related article on page a 3 . ) any merger of the two companies would probably face lengthy regulatory scrutiny , so dynegy is also considering injecting $ 1 . 5 billion into enron immediately to help stabilize the company ' s finances , according to people familiar with the situation . the deal would also include a significant role for oil powerhouse chevrontexaco , which owns a 26 % stake in dynegy and would be likely to provide much of the cash for any enron transaction . dynegy ' s emergence as a serious bidder for enron could indicate to other interested parties that enron ' s problems can be solved . in fact , the collapse in enron ' s stock price would make it fairly easy for another large energy player to top any dynegy offer . royal dutch / shell group is one such prominent company . a takeover by dynegy or any other company would almost certainly presage the departure of the 59 - year - old mr . lay . he oversaw the transformation of enron from a nondescript natural - gas pipeline company with annual revenue of under $ 5 billion in the late 1980 s to a global energy colossus with revenue that is expected to approach $ 200 billion this year . it has turned out that the formula behind that transformation contained the seeds for the company ' s current troubles . executives created an ever - more - labyrinthine financial structure to support enron ' s explosive growth rate . billions of dollars of debt - - which could have weakened enron ' s credit rating and slowed growth - - was kept off the balance sheet through tangled webs of transactions with dozens of related entities . as the financial demands became greater and the transactions more complex , enron officials began creating and heading some of the entities , raising serious conflict - of - interest questions . neither enron nor dynegy would comment . royal dutch / shell also declined to comment . messrs . lay , skilling and fastow either declined to comment or didn ' t return phone calls seeking interviews . enron officials have maintained that the markets are overreacting to a spate of bad , but nonfatal , news . on oct . 16 , the company announced a $ 618 million third - quarter loss and disclosed a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction of shareholder equity due in part to dealings with the fastow - related partnerships . the company has said that its ongoing businesses are strong and it has the financial wherewithal to weather the crisis . all of its actions have been legal and properly disclosed , enron has stressed . still , its predicament is daunting . the securities and exchange commission has started a formal investigation into possible violations of federal securities law involving the fastow - related partnerships . several shareholder lawsuits seeking class - action status have been filed against top company officials , alleging fraud and seeking to recover some of the $ 20 billion in market value that enron shares have lost in the past month . to address growing jitters in the energy and financial markets , enron has drawn down billions of dollars of credit lines , negotiated new ones and sought a new equity infusion . as turmoil has engulfed the company , mr . lay and other top enron executives have kept largely out of public view - - in sharp contrast to the company ' s normally outspoken public persona . the one recent public - relations initiative , a conference call for analysts and big investors , turned into what even enron officials concede privately was a debacle . it left company executives looking evasive and defensive rather than open and confident . how did enron , which routinely made published lists of the most - admired and innovative companies in america , fly so high and fall so fast ? the answer lies in a combination of brilliance and overconfidence on a scale rarely seen in the business world . in the process , the company helped redefine much of the energy marketplace on matters as fundamental as how power is bought and sold and how a company produces a profit from doing so . for example , the company helped create an electricity - trading market in which participants rarely take physical delivery of the commodity but instead merely tally profits or losses from transactions . in the accounting realm , it pioneered techniques that allowed energy companies to record profits or losses on long - term contracts that hadn ' t yet produced any revenue .  we caught a little flak in the early 1990 s from people who , i guess , thought we were pulling a fast one ,  enron ' s chief accounting officer , richard causey , said in an interview in august . he added that this accounting method was the most accurate way to measure energy - trading results . enron ' s audacity and success sent other energy companies scrambling to emulate it , a process that abn amro analyst paul patterson calls  enron envy .  the company tested the limits of securities and accounting rules . for example , enron ' s sec filings have included statements about the fastow - related transactions that might meet the letter of disclosure laws but are so complex that even some wall street analysts and accounting professors have found them indecipherable . enron ' s seemingly impenetrable financial structure , hardly noticed by wall street in the company ' s heyday , is now a matter of serious concern in a suddenly skeptical investment community .  it ' s not easy to regain something as basic as trust ,  says goldman sachs analyst david fleischer , a longtime enron fan . in the recent conference call with enron executives , mr . fleischer pleaded with the company to be more forthcoming about its operations - - something it has been promising to do for months . while enron employs some 20 , 000 people , its rise and fall can , in large measure , be traced to three men : messrs . lay , skilling and fastow . mr . lay joined the company in 1984 when it was still called houston natural gas , a regional pipeline operator . back then , the natural - gas industry was a largely regional business and about as exciting as watching a pipeline operate . but mr . lay had big plans for his company , always preaching that natural gas was the fuel of the future . his prediction has been largely borne out when it comes to such functions as fueling electric - power plants . he wanted to take the company beyond natural gas . enron bought an electric utility in portland , ore . , and built power plants around the world . it developed its potent energy - trading operation , which buys and sells contracts to provide electricity in the same way that contracts for wheat and pork bellies are traded . these deals were done with utilities , industrial power users and other trading firms . to help enlarge this empire , he recruited aggressive young executives . none was brighter or more assertive than mr . skilling , a harvard business school graduate and former mckinsey & co . consultant who joined enron in 1990 . under messrs . lay and skilling , the company pushed zealously for the deregulation of energy markets - - particularly that bastion of monopoly businesses , the electric - utility industry . enron officials argued that open , competitive markets could help consumers and , not coincidentally , provide huge profit opportunities in energy trading . mr . skilling called the energy - trading business  a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity to establish a position to last for the next 100 years .  by the late 1990 s , enron had evolved into primarily a trading company , rather than an owner of power plants and pipelines . in pursuit of their deregulation goals , enron officials became major players in american politics . mr . lay has given nearly $ 2 million to president bush during his political career and is a personal friend of the president , vice president cheney and several members of the cabinet . one of mr . skilling ' s early hires after joining enron was mr . fastow , at the time a 29 - year - old mba from northwestern ' s kellogg school who had been working on leveraged buyouts and other complicated deals at continental bank in chicago . former enron officials and others say that mr . skilling quickly became mr . fastow ' s mentor in the same way that mr . lay had become mr . skilling ' s . as mr . skilling oversaw the building of enron ' s vast trading operation , mr . fastow saw to the financing of it .  andy was the guy you saw when you wanted money  for a project , says one former enron senior manager . mr . skilling was named enron ' s chief operating officer in 1997 . mr . fastow got the top finance job a year later , at the age of 36 . under mr . fastow , enron ' s finance department tripled in size , to more than 100 people . enron needed the added financial brainpower . as it expanded , debt and liquidity were constant concerns . what ' s more , the company ' s ambitions were roving beyond therms and kilowatts as it began to make markets in everything from water to weather . enron ' s most highly touted non - energy initiative , and mr . skilling ' s pet project , came in the area of telecommunications . the company built a coast - to - coast fiber - optic network and envisioned trading  bandwidth ,  or network capacity , the way it traded electricity or natural gas . enron has invested several hundred million dollars so far in the project , which has produced losses of over $ 400 million . yet at the february analyst meeting in houston , mr . skilling unabashedly valued enron ' s fiber - optic business at $ 36 billion , according to people who were at the meeting . but to make all of its growth dreams possible , enron had to make sure that its balance sheet didn ' t become too laden with debt . too much debt would lead major ratings agencies , such as moody ' s investors service and standard & poor ' s , to lower enron ' s credit rating . such downgrades could significantly increase the company ' s cost of borrowing and make it more difficult to finance its continued expansion . in typically aggressive fashion , enron lobbied the ratings agencies with the same vigor that it lobbied legislators . at the february meeting , mr . fastow urged analysts to raise enron ' s credit rating on long - term debt from triple - b - plus to single - a - minus . but the analysts shrugged off mr . fastow ' s entreaties . they didn ' t see the cash flow , earnings , or debt coverage required for such an upgrade , says one attendee . undeterred , mr . fastow said the higher rating would strengthen the company ' s basic finances , which could then justify the higher rating . this circular argument provoked derision among analysts , and enron didn ' t get its ` a ' rating . instead , the company was recently downgraded by the major ratings agencies as a result of its financial turmoil . in moves that kept down its reported debt burden , enron turned increasingly to off - balance - sheet transactions through limited partnerships with outside parties . in such an arrangement , enron could contribute money , stock or other assets to the partnership . the partnership could then borrow large sums to purchase assets or do business deals without the debt showing up on enron ' s books . while such partnership transactions had long been used in the natural - gas industry to finance deals , enron took the practice to new heights of complexity . leading that effort was mr . fastow and his team of young financial experts . in recent years , enron has done myriad deals with more than 30 partnerships . by far the most controversial to come to light , so far , are the ones it has done with two partnerships - - known as ljm cayman lp and ljm 2 co - investment lp - - which were formed and operated by mr . fastow . the company has said that its transactions with these partnerships were designed to hedge against fluctuating market values of company assets and energy contracts . it isn ' t clear why enron would allow its chief financial officer to be in a fiduciary position at partnerships that stood to profit , possibly at the company ' s expense , from doing deals with it . to make matters worse , private ljm partnership documents indicate that mr . fastow personally made millions of dollars from the partnerships - - much more than he was being paid as enron ' s chief financial officer . enron officials have repeatedly said that mr . fastow ' s actions were reviewed and approved by top management and the board of directors . however , the company has refused to answer numerous specific questions about its dealings with the partnerships . enron has said that mr . fastow formally severed his ties with the partnerships in july in the face of rising discomfort about the arrangements on the part of analysts and major company investors . it is nearly impossible to stitch together anything comprehensible about the partnership deals from enron ' s sec filings . the only thing clear is that millions of shares of enron stock and billions of dollars of assets and notes were involved in the transactions . -

June 4, 1999- Sirs: The following text was located on a site written or placed by you or under your control: DOM is located on Karitane Island and now includes the Taongi Atoll in the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the South Pacific 1000 miles south of Tahiti. However, the Marshall Islands government has condemned the fraudulent assertions of two organizations, namely the DOM and sister nation, the Kingdom of EnenKio (the Marshallese name for Wake Island), claiming to represent the mid-Pacific nation amid an alleged investment scam according to an article in Agence France- Presse. The Marshall Islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of either nation. A Honolulu-based attorney created the Kingdom of EnenKio in the early 1990s. It was based on a power of attorney agreement with Marshall Islands paramount chief Mursel Hermios, which granted the attorney broad powers to act on his behalf. The Marshall Islands High Court has ruled the agreement invalid and ordered it nullified, which the kingdom has disputed. http://www.goldhaven.com/issue4/Two.htm (disconnected as of 2/1/00) The purpose of this letter is lodge a formal request for correction of false and misleading statements made by the author regarding the Kingdom of EnenKio. While I am pleased to find you have apparently taken a serious interest in the Kingdom of EnenKio, I am aghast at how distorted, erroneous and misleading the article is. As a consequence of my service to His Majesty King Remios and the people of EnenKio, I am obligated to respond to incidents such as this. I will respectfully offer the following line by line correction. For your convenience, your text will be set off (with **) in color: **DOM is located on Karitane Island and now includes the Taongi Atoll in the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the South Pacific 1000 miles south of Tahiti.** (Comment: The construction of this statement implies the Marshall Islands are in the South Pacific Ocean 1000 miles south of Tahiti, in which case a reader may be misled.) Correction: DOM is located on Karitane Island in the South Pacific, 1000 miles south of Tahiti, and now includes Taongi Atoll in the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the North Pacific. **However, the Marshall Islands government has condemned the fraudulent assertions of two organizations, ...** (Comment: Just because the RMI government ...has condemned the 'fraudulent assertions' ...of ...EnenKio..., does that make it true? Why would you want to quote anything from a government that has been internationally criticized [and documented] time and again for fraud, abuse of human rights, outright theft and is in default on almost every financial obligation it has ever made? What purpose do you propose to serve by attacking a concerned group of dedicated people fighting for the very lives of Marshallese natives who have been overrun by foreign invaders, bathed in radiation from nuclear fallout and abused by their own corrupt government?) **...namely the DOM and sister nation, the Kingdom of EnenKio (the Marshallese name for Wake Island),...** (Comment: Nothing could be further from the truth. we cannot speak for DOM, but as for the Kingdom, we don't even know what being a sister nation means and for you to make this categorically false statement is not only a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of EnenKio, it is a deceptive intrusion upon the sovereign, His Majesty King Remios, the sovereign of EnenKio and Eneen-Kio Atoll, and an inexplicable and irresponsible abuse of journalism. Doesn't anybody check sources anymore?) Correction: The Kingdom of EnenKio is an independent sovereign state and the same could be said for DOM. **...claiming to represent the mid-Pacific nation amid an alleged investment scam according to an article in Agence France- Presse.** (Comment: The government of the Kingdom of EnenKio represents the people of EnenKio, who are forced to live in exile from Eneen-Kio Atoll, lands and seas that played a significant role in Marshallese culture for perhaps 2000 years. Furthermore, ...an article in Agence France-Presse has no merit as it was authored by a source in the Marshall Islands government. My preceding comments apply. The Kingdom of EnenKio is not now and never has been engaged in an ...investment scam.... We have tried for many years to attract qualified investors and funding sources for programs that will not only benefit the people of EnenKio, but also will positively impact people around the globe. In fact, we are currently working with a former NASA Astronaut. One tool scammers have in their arsenal is to discredit visionary programs of legitimate entities so they can feed on carcasses of the ignorant. Many journalists use the same technique to sell their stories on sensationalism. Doesn't anybody check sources anymore?) **The Marshall Islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of either nation.** (Comment: The Kingdom of EnenKio has made no fraudulent claims of which I am aware, and in my post, I am responsible for all published information. I would personally caution any ..countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of... nations, companies or publications if I had credible proof to that effect. However, my preceding comments apply as to credibility of any RMI ministry source. Furthermore, the RMI has repeatedly attacked the credibility of His Majesty King Hermios, who happens to be the ancestral sovereign owner under Marshallese custom of over 1/3 of the land in the Marshall Islands, including recent attempts to sequester him against his will. We believe some officials in the RMI are afraid of what will happen to them if honesty and integrity returns to the administration of lands and programs to assist the people with their pressing needs and they no longer have their hands on the till. To perpetrate their jaundiced agenda is an irresponsible abuse of journalism.) **A Honolulu-based attorney created the Kingdom of EnenKio in the early 1990s.** (Comment: Mr. Moore is not an Attorney, though he was living in Honolulu in the early 1990s.) Correction: The Kingdom of EnenKio was established by decree of the owner of Eneen-Kio Atoll [a.k.a. Enen-kio, Halcyon, Disclerta, Wake and 6-8 other names], Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios, who then was Paramount Chief of the Northern Ratak atolls [he passed away in December 1998] and was fully recognized by the RMI government. He declared the sovereign state of EnenKio in 1994, whereupon the people chose him as their King over Eneen-Kio Atoll, ratified the Constitution and established government as a limited constitutional monarchy. **It was based on a power of attorney agreement with Marshall Islands paramount chief Mursel (sic) Hermios, which granted the attorney broad powers to act on his behalf.** Correction: The establishment of the Kingdom of EnenKio was made possible by Murjel's appointment of Mr. Robert Moore, the adopted brother of Hermios, Alab of Taongi Atoll and a private citizen, to the post of Minister Plenipotentiary. The document of appointment was also a Special Power of Attorney which granted Mr. Moore very specific instructions to do whatever was possible to expel the United States from Eneen-Kio Atoll and establish an independent state on Hermios' and the people's behalf. **The Marshall Islands High Court has ruled the agreement invalid and ordered it nullified, which the kingdom has disputed.** (Comment: Since when is a Special Power of Attorney an agreement? The Marshall Islands High Court has no record or knowledge of the Special Power of Attorney, except as has been publicized by the Kingdom of EnenKio, and certainly exercises no jurisdiction over Eneen-Kio Atoll, which lies over 100 miles north of lawful RMI boundaries. The RMI has no political or territorial jurisdiction over the islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll because the atoll, by any name you choose, was not incorporated into the RMI when it formed its government in 1979, nor was it subsequently incorporated by any act, law, mandate or otherwise of any present or former Iroijlaplap or Monarch of Eneen-Kio and any statement to the contrary is false, fraudulent and irresponsible.) Finally, I suggest you, as a journalist or publisher, do a little more research, not only into establishment and development of the Kingdom of EnenKio, but into the prehistoric history and more recent U.S. invasion of Eneen-Kio Atoll, properly named by 'Marshallese' centuries before arrival of colonial western powers and missionaries. Then I invite you to our Embassy in Honolulu to review the public files and documents mentioned above, all of which exist in hard copy (not in 'cyberspace') and most of which are referenced or published at our official web site. Be sure to view the documents at our Resource Center which show, in many cases, full-color digitized letters of correspondence with the 59 or so states in the world, many of which are first world. In closing, I would simply appeal to your presumed sense of morality and ethics and request the referenced article be amended or corrected and , if corrected elsewhere, that a link be provided to the relevant paragraph cited above in the article. SKIP TO NEXT FILE ├»┬┐┬¢TOP OF PAGE June 3, 1999- Sir: The following report was sent to me in which the author mentions the Kingdom of EnenKio (thank you for spelling 'EnenKio' correctly. The purpose of this letter below is to lodge a formal request for correction of false and misleading statements made by the author regarding the Kingdom of EnenKio. Fantasy Island -- Melchizedek passport scam reveals how the Internet can take fraud to new frontiers By Bertil Lintner in Bangkok, December 10, 1998: Determined not to give up, Pedley moved his fictional nation once again, this time to Taongi atoll in the Western Pacific. According to a Melchizedek press release, posted on its home page, Taongi was leased in 1997 under a treaty with representatives of the kingdom of EnenKio, another only-in- cyberspace country, which in this case claims the U.S.-held Wake Island. In real life, Taongi is an uninhabited atoll in the Marshall Islands. http://www.feer.com/Restricted/index_corrections.html (link to article of December 24, 1998: Fantasy Island, disconnected as of 2/1/00) Response to the author: I am unable to locate the Melchizedek press release you cited, indicating that ...Taongi was leased in 1997 under a treaty with representatives of the kingdom of EnenKio,.... Such an act would be impossible and implausible as EnenKio has no legal authority or political jurisdiction over Taongi Atoll in the Marshall Islands. Further more, Melchizedek (DOM) is not so uninformed as to publicly advertise an illegal act in the midst of attempting to find a suitable land base for its people to administer their form of government. The Kingdom of EnenKio did enter into a treaty with DOM on the 19th day of September, 1997, but it did not convey a lease of land. It declared a state of peace and established diplomatic recognition between our governments. However, a prior agreement, signed in May 1997, which had nothing to do with the Kingdom of EnenKio, transferred Mr. Robert Moore's rights to develop Taongi from Mr. Moore to DOM. It did not convey a lease at that time and no such document is in existence. This was made possible because Mr. Moore is the Alab (one class of landowner) of Taongi and had a legal power of attorney pertaining to Taongi Atoll, from the principal landowner, Iroijlaplap (Paramount Chief) Murjel Hermios, who was aware of and supported the transaction. Consideration, if any, under the agreement was personally retained by Mr. Moore, who is also the adopted brother of Hermios. Now, please understand, that while Mr. Moore was acting in the latter case on his own behalf, and that of the future use and development of Taongi, which would have generated an income to Iroijlaplap Hermios, Mr. Moore wears another hat as Minister Plenipotentiary of the Kingdom of EnenKio. Iroijlaplap Hermios, also wore (he died in December 10, 1998, the same date of your article) other hats: one as First Monarch, King of the Kingdom of EnenKio and one as owner in allodium of Eneen-Kio Atoll (a.k.a. Enen-kio, Halcyon, Disclerta, Wake and several other names). For you to state the Kingdom of EnenKio is ...another only-in- cyberspace country..., as you did in the above article, is not only a completely and categorically false statement, but it is a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of EnenKio. And, it is a blatant deceptive intrusion upon His Majesty King Hermios, the sovereign of EnenKio and Eneen-Kio Atoll, and an inexplicable and irresponsible abuse of your journalistic license -- unless, of course, your statement could be proved accurate. I suggest you do a little more research, not only into the establishment and development of the Kingdom of EnenKio, but into the prehistoric history and more recent U.S. invasion of Eneen-Kio Atoll, properly named by 'Marshallese' centuries before arrival of colonial western powers and missionaries. Then I invite you to our Embassy in Honolulu to review the public files, all of which exist in hard copy (not 'cyberspace') and most of which are referenced or published at our official web address: Be sure to view the documents at our Resource Center which show, in many cases, full-color digitized letters of correspondence with the 59 or so states in the world, many of which are first world. In closing, I would simply appeal to your presumed sense of morality and ethics and request the referenced article be amended or corrected and that the link be added to the relevant paragraph cited above in the article. SKIP TO NEXT FILE ├»┬┐┬¢TOP OF PAGE June 2, 1999- Sir: The following statement (in quotes) was copied from one of your Footnotes to History -D and E (disconnected as of 12/1/00). Enenkio Atoll- In 1898, the United States annexed Wake Island, in the Marshall Islands of the western Pacific. After the Marshalls became a U.S. Trust Territory, the traditional chiefs of the area agitated for recognition that Wake Island was a part of the Marianas chain, and pressed their historical claims to the atoll, called Enenkio locally. The U.S. government has consistently ignored these claims. The protests took a sharper turn after the U.S. Congress in 1993 acknowledged the illegality a hundred years earlier of the establishment by Americans of the Republic of Hawai'i. King Murjel Hermios, who is paramount chief of an archipelago in the northern Marshalls, declared Wake Island's independence in 1987. The Marshalls recognized this claim shortly after the nation gained its independence. In return for his services as Minister Plenipotentiary in the United States, Hermios granted American businessman Robert Moore land on Taongi Atoll in the northern Marshalls, which Moore has declared the Dominion of Melchizedek. Comment: With all candor, I cannot figure how such straight forward facts such as we have presented to the public and over the Internet since 1994 could have possibly been construed into the above referenced text. While I am pleased to find you have apparently taken a very serious interest (unless your site is intended as some twisted joke, which I am assuming is not the case) in the history of the Kingdom of EnenKio, I am aghast at how distorted, erroneous and misleading your summary is. As a consequence of my service to His Majesty King Remios and the people of EnenKio, I will respectfully offer the following line by line correction. For your convenience, your text will be set off (with **) in color: **In 1898, the United States annexed Wake Island, in the Marshall Islands of the western Pacific.** Correction: In 1898, the United States invaded Wake Island, the northernmost atoll -- actually named Eneen-Kio centuries before western explorers arrived -- of the Ratak chain of Marshall Islands in Micronesia and the Central North Pacific Ocean. The Author responds: Rest assured that I did not mean to downplay the role of violence in the American acquisition of the territory. **After the Marshalls became a U.S. Trust Territory, the traditional chiefs of the area agitated for recognition that Wake Island was a part of the Marianas chain, and pressed their historical claims to the atoll, called Enenkio locally.** Correction: Following W.W.II, the Trust Territories of the Pacific, which included the Marshall Islands, was placed under administration of the United States by the United Nations. While Eneen-Kio was well established as one of the Marshalls, the U.S. only knew it as Wake and, having lost many U.S. lives there in 1941 at the hands of Japanese invaders, kept control of it. In 1993, the Paramount Chief of the Ratak atolls pressed his clan's historical and lawful claim to the 3 islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll. The Author responds: I don't see much conflict between the two versions here. **The U.S. government has consistently ignored these claims.** Correction: The U.S. government has consistently ignored claims from the Marshall Islands government, which failed to exert a claim during its move to independence in 1979, and from the former traditional landowners, including Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios. The Author responds: I will note this. **The protests took a sharper turn after the U.S. Congress in 1993 acknowledged the illegality a hundred years earlier of the establishment by Americans of the Republic of Hawai'i.** Correction: The Eneen-Kio claims gained some new momentum after precedents were set by the U.S. Congress, when in 1993 they acknowledged the illegality of the 1893 overthrow of the Monarch of the Kingdom of Hawai'i by a group of American businessmen and U.S. Marines, and in the following year returned the island of Kaho'olawe to the Hawaiian People. **King Murjel Hermios, who is paramount chief of an archipelago in the northern Marshalls, declared Wake Island's independence in 1987.** Correction: King Murjel Hermios, who was Paramount Chief until his death in December 1998, declared the sovereign state of EnenKio in 1994, whereupon the people chose him as their King over Eneen-Kio Atoll, ratified the Constitution and established government as a limited constitutional monarchy. The Author responds: I will make the necessary corrections here. **The Marshalls recognized this claim shortly after the nation gained its independence. In return for his services as Minister Plenipotentiary in the United States, Hermios granted American businessman Robert Moore land on Taongi Atoll in the northern Marshalls, which Moore has declared the Dominion of Melchizedek.** Correction: After the death of the First Monarch, his brother Remios succeeded to the throne as Second Monarch and rules along with his brother, Crown Prince Lobadreo, over the Kingdom of EnenKio today. To continue the commentary: The parts left out were either wrong or have nothing to do with the history of the Kingdom of EnenKio itself. Since HM King Remios also succeeded to Iroijlaplap of the northern Ratak atolls of the Marshall Islands, he also has responsibilities over 10 atolls, 2 islands and over 300 atoll islets. But that is another story, which has nothing directly to do with the Kingdom of EnenKio. I have offered this treatise in hopes that you will find the time to correct your site per my suggestions. Please feel free to contact me or view our pages at the address above. Thank you in advance for your attention and interest in this matter. The Author responds: I imagine that you are asserting here that Moore's Melchizedek project (which can be located on the web through the Sources & Bibliography section of my web page) is non-existent. Be assured I will look further into\par this. Thank you again for your response, Captain Rydell. I should be posting a revised version of the page in the next week or so. (June 7, 1999) SKIP TO NEXT FILE ├»┬┐┬¢TOP OF PAGE June 1, 1999: News Release Part One Background: On May 21, 1999, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands posted a press release on the Internet at: http://www.yokwe.net/mboard/newsinfo/thread.cgi?67,0\cf0 (discontinued as of 12/1/00). The author, Mr. Joseph Biglar, Undersecretary, is not known to us, has not heretofore communicated with the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, nor with its Monarch, His Majesty King Remios, at any time and has no knowledge of any policies or state activities of EnenKio. There is no valid reason to assume that the said press release is indeed an official document. The Republic of the Marshall Islands has perfect knowledge that representatives of the Kingdom of EnenKio, headed by His Majesty King Remios, on the basis of his proper and lawful authority, have the right and obligation to speak in support of the interests of certain persons, many of whom happen to be Marshallese nationals residing in the Marshall Islands. Response to so-called Press Release: This unprovoked attack upon His Majesty King Remios, Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio, by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands is wholly false. It is also unjustifiably inflammatory and amounts to little more than an unquestionable confirmation of the predilection for infringement upon Marshallese sovereign rights exercised by the current administration of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, which has been confirmed by the U.S. State Department. (See: Human Rights Report) This public posting shall serve as constructive notice to the Marshall Islands Government that any attempt to interfere in the business of His Majesty King Remios, Iroijlaplap of the Northern Ratak atolls of the Marshall Islands, or any acts, decisions, mandates, announcements or directives thereby, shall be met with definitive responses equal to the degrees of contravention.

[Paragraph 4] Thus, it is now possible for an enterprising jurisdiction anywhere in the world to establish itself as an emerging OFC. The newest OFCs, e.g., Niue and the Marshall Islands, are now sprouting in remote areas of the world, such as the Pacific. Even more remote are mere figments of fertile imaginations such as the Dominion of Malchizedek (sic) or The Kingdom of Enenkio Atol (sic), both entirely fraudulent in intent and practice. [note: OFC = Offshore Financial Center] Response: This unprovoked attack upon His Majesty King Remios, Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio, the sovereign state of EnenKio and its noble citizenry by the U.S. Department of State is a reprehensible categorically false challenge of the sovereignty of the Kingdom of EnenKio. It is also unjustifiably inflammatory and amounts to an unqualified felonious defamation of the international reputation of His Majesty King Remios, the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio and organs thereof. The unmitigated audacity and arrogance of the United States to attempt to link the Kingdom of EnenKio with International Crime, narcotics trafficking, money laundering, tax evasion, international drug cartels, terrorists, bank fraud or any other sort of criminal activity, without even one microscopic fragment of substantive evidence to corroborate such deliberately nefarious statements is reprehensible in the least. This public posting shall serve as constructive notice to the United States Government that any attempt to interfere in the business of His Majesty King Remios, Iroijlaplap of the Northern Ratak atolls of the Marshall Islands, or any acts, decisions, mandates, announcements or directives thereby, shall be met with definitive responses equal to the degrees of contravention. Furthermore, this matter will not be resolved until the President of the United States issues a formal apology to His Majesty King Remios, along with the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, and the Congress of the United States initiates a thorough investigation into the abuses of power, subversion of natural rights and illegal occupation by the United States of the islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll. Congressional representatives to Hawaii, the nearest State of the United States to Eneen-Kio Atoll, and those of other states, have repeatedly been advised of the foregoing atrocities and conditions and have failed to respond in kind. The United States is obligated as the self-assured trustee of Pacific Island States in Micronesia to respond to the charges of ethnic cleansing and her responsibility to EnenKio is no less.

6609,"60 Minutes II Bush Interview:(CBS)├é┬áNo president since Abraham Lincoln has seen such horrific loss of life in a war on American soil. No president since James Madison, nearly 200 years ago, has seen the nation├óÔé¼Ôäós capital city successfully attacked. But, one year ago, President George W. Bush was thrown into the first great crisis of the 21st century.This is the president├óÔé¼Ôäós story of September 11th and the week America went to war. 60 Minutes II spent two hours with Mr. Bush, one, on Air Force One and another in the Oval Office last week. Even after a year, the president is still moved, sometimes to the point of tears, when he remembers Sept. 11.├óÔé¼┼ôI knew, the farther we get away from Sept.11, the more likely it is for some around the world to forget the mission, but not me,├óÔé¼┬Ø Mr. Bush says during the Air Force One interview. ├óÔé¼┼ôNot me. I made the pledge to myself and to people that I├óÔé¼Ôäóm not going to forget what happened on Sept. 11. So long as I├óÔé¼Ôäóm president, we will pursue the killers and bring them to justice. We owe that to those who have lost their lives.├óÔé¼┬ØThe memories come back sharp and clear on Air Force One, where Pelley joined the president for a recent trip across country. 60 Minutes II wanted to talk to him there because that is where he spent the first hours after the attack.Not since Lyndon Johnson was sworn in on Air Force One has the airplane been so central to America in a crisis.For President Bush, Sept. 11 2001, started with the usual routine. Before dawn, the president was on his four-mile run. It was just before 6 a.m. and, at the same moment, another man was on the move: Mohammad Atta. Two hours later, as Mr. Bush drove to an elementary school, hijackers on four planes were murdering the flight crews and turning the airliners east. As the motorcade neared the school at 8:45 a.m., jet engines echoed in Manhattan.Atta plunged the 767 jumbo jet into World Trade Center Tower One.├óÔé¼┼ôI thought it was an accident,├óÔé¼┬Ø says Mr. Bush. ├óÔé¼┼ôI thought it was a pilot error. I thought that some foolish soul had gotten lost and - and made a terrible mistake.├óÔé¼┬ØMr. Bush was told about the first plane just before sitting down with a class of second graders. He was watching a reading drill when, just after nine, United Flight 175 exploded into the second tower. There was the sudden realization that what had seemed like a terrible mistake was a coordinated attack.Back in the Florida classroom, press secretary Ari Fleischer got the news on his pager. The president├óÔé¼Ôäós chief-of-staff, Andy Card stepped in.├óÔé¼┼ôA second plane hit the second tower, America is under attack,├óÔé¼┬Ø Card told the presidentWhen he said those words, what did he see in the President├óÔé¼Ôäós face?├óÔé¼┼ôI saw him coming to recognition of what I had said,├óÔé¼┬Ø Card recalls. ├óÔé¼┼ôI think he understood that he was going to have to take command as commander-in-chief, not just as president.├óÔé¼┬ØWhat was going through Bush├óÔé¼Ôäós mind when he heard the news?├óÔé¼┼ôWe├óÔé¼Ôäóre at war and somebody has dared attack us and we├óÔé¼Ôäóre going to do something about it,├óÔé¼┬Ø Mr. Bush recalls. ├óÔé¼┼ôI realized I was in a unique setting to receive a message that somebody attacked us, and I was looking at these little children and all of the sudden we were at war. I can remember noticing the press pool and the press corps beginning to get the calls and seeing the look on their face. And it became evident that we were, you know, that the world had changed.├óÔé¼┬ØMr. Bush walked into a classroom set up with a secure phone. He called the vice president, pulling the phone cord tight as he spun to see the attack on TV. Then he grabbed a legal pad and quickly wrote his first words to the nation.Ladies and gentlemen, this is a difficult moment for America,├óÔé¼┬Ø he said in the speech. ├óÔé¼┼ôToday, we├óÔé¼Ôäóve had a national tragedy.├óÔé¼┬ØIt was 9:30 a.m. As he spoke, Mr. Bush didn├óÔé¼Ôäót know that two more hijacked jets were streaking toward Washington. Vice Pesident Dick Cheney was in his office at the White House when a Secret Service agent ran in.├óÔé¼┼ôHe said to me, ├óÔé¼╦£Sir, we have to leave immediately├óÔé¼Ôäó and grabbed, put a hand on my belt, another hand on my shoulder and propelled me out the door of my office,├óÔé¼┬Ø Cheney recalls. ├óÔé¼┼ôI├óÔé¼Ôäóm not sure how they do it, but they sort of levitate you down the hallway, you move very fast.├óÔé¼┬Ø├óÔé¼┼ôThere wasn├óÔé¼Ôäót a lot of time for chitchat, you know, with the vice president,├óÔé¼┬Ø says Secret Service Director Brian Stafford, who was in his command center ordering the round-up of top officials and the First Family. He felt that he had only minutes to work with. ├óÔé¼┼ôWe knew there were unidentified planes tracking in our direction,├óÔé¼┬Ø he says.Cheney was rushed deep under the White House into a bunker called the Presidential Emergency Operations Center. It was built for war, and this was it. On her way down, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice called Mr. Bush.├óÔé¼┼ôIt was brief because I was being pushed to get off the phone and get out of the West Wing,├óÔé¼┬Ø says Rice. ├óÔé¼┼ôThey were hurrying me off the phone with the president and I just said, he said, ├óÔé¼╦£I├óÔé¼Ôäóm coming back├óÔé¼Ôäó and we said ├óÔé¼╦£Mr. President that may not be wise.├óÔé¼Ôäó I remember stopping briefly to call my family, my aunt and uncle in Alabama and say, ├óÔé¼╦£I├óÔé¼Ôäóm fine. You have to tell everybody that I├óÔé¼Ôäóm fine├óÔé¼Ôäó but then settling into trying to deal with the enormity of that moment, and in the first few hours, I think the thing that was on everybody├óÔé¼Ôäós mind was how many more planes are coming.├óÔé¼┬ØThe Capitol was evacuated. And for the first time ever, the Secret Service executed the emergency plan to ensure the presidential line of succession. Agents swept up the 15 officials who stood to become president if the others were killed. They wanted to move Vice President Cheney, fearing he was in danger even in the bunker. But Cheney says when he heard the other officials were safe, he decided to stay at the White House, no matter what.├óÔé¼┼ôIt├óÔé¼Ôäós important to emphasize it's not personal, you don├óÔé¼Ôäót think of it in personal terms, you├óÔé¼Ôäóve got a professional job to do,├óÔé¼┬Ø says Cheney.Cheney was joined by transportation secretary Norm Mineta who remembers hearing the FAA counting down the hijacked jets closing in on the capital.Says Mineta: ├óÔé¼┼ôSomeone came in and said ├óÔé¼╦£Mr. Vice president there├óÔé¼Ôäós a plane 50 miles out,├óÔé¼Ôäó then he came in and said ├óÔé¼╦£Its now 10 miles out, we don├óÔé¼Ôäót know where it is exactly, but it├óÔé¼Ôäós coming in low and fast.├óÔé¼Ôäó├óÔé¼┬ØIt was American Flight 77. At 9:38 a.m., it exploded into the Pentagon, the first successful attack on Washington since the War of 1812.As the Pentagon burned, Mr. Bush├óÔé¼Ôäós limousine sped toward Air Force One in Florida. At that moment, United Flight 93 - the last hijacked plane - was taking dead aim at Washington. At the White House, the staff was in the West Wing cafeteria, watching on TV. Press Secretary Jennifer Millerwise was in the crowd when the order came to evacuate.├óÔé¼┼ôI no sooner walked outside when someone from the Secret Service yelled ├óÔé¼╦£Women drop your heels and run, drop your heels and run,├óÔé¼Ôäó and suddenly the gates that never open except for authorized vehicles just opened and the whole White House just flooded out,├óÔé¼┬Ø she recalls.In Florida, as Mr. Bush boarded Air Force One, he was overheard telling a Secret Service agent ├óÔé¼┼ôBe sure to get the First Lady and my daughters protected.├óÔé¼┬Ø At 9:57 a.m., Air Force One thundered down the runway, blasting smoke and dust in a full -hrust take off. Communications Director Dan Bartlett was on board.├óÔé¼┼ôIt was like a rocket,├óÔé¼┬Ø he remembers. ├óÔé¼┼ôFor a good ten minutes, the plane was going almost straight up.├óÔé¼┬ØAt the same moment, 56 minutes after it was hit, World Trade Center Tower Two began to falter, then cascade in an incomprehensible avalanche of steel, concrete and human lives.├óÔé¼┼ôSomeone said to me, ├óÔé¼╦£Look at that├óÔé¼Ôäó I remember that, ├óÔé¼╦£Look at that├óÔé¼Ôäó and I looked up and I saw and I just remember a cloud of dust and smoke and the horror of that moment,├óÔé¼┬Ø recalls Rice of the TV newscast.She also felt something in her gut: ├óÔé¼┼ôThat we├óÔé¼Ôäóve lost a lot of Americans and that eventually we would get these people. I felt the anger. Of course I felt the anger.├óÔé¼┬ØDown in the bunker, Cheney was trying to figure out how many hijacked planes there were. Officials feared there could be as many as 11.As the planes track toward Washington, a discussion begins about whether to shoot them down. ├óÔé¼┼ôI discussed it with the president,├óÔé¼┬Ø Cheney recalls. ├óÔé¼┼ô├óÔé¼╦£Are we prepared to order our aircraft to shoot down these airliners that have been hijacked?├óÔé¼Ôäó He said yes.├óÔé¼┬Ø├óÔé¼┼ôIt was my advice. It was his decision,├óÔé¼┬Ø says Cheney.├óÔé¼┼ôThat├óÔé¼Ôäós a sobering moment to order your own combat aircraft to shoot down your own civilian aircraft,├óÔé¼┬Ø says Bush. ├óÔé¼┼ôBut it was an easy decision to make given the ├óÔé¼ÔÇ£ given the fact that we had learned that a commercial aircraft was being used as a weapon. I say easy decision, it was, I didn├óÔé¼Ôäót hesitate, let me put it that way. I knew what had to be done.├óÔé¼┬ØThe passengers on United Flight 93 also knew what had to be done. They fought for control and sacrificed themselves in a Pennsylvania meadow. The flight was 15 minutes from Washington.├óÔé¼┼ôClearly, the terrorists were trying to take out as many symbols of government as they could: the Pentagon, perhaps the Capitol, perhaps the White House. These people saved us not only physically but they saved us psychologically and symbolically in a very important way, too,├óÔé¼┬Ø says Rice.Meanwhile, Tower One was weakening. It had stood for an hour and 43 minutes. At 10:29 a.m., it buckled in a mirror image of the collapse of its twin.The image that went round the world reached the First Lady in a secure location somewhere in Washington. ├óÔé¼┼ôI was horrified,├óÔé¼┬Ø she says. ├óÔé¼┼ôI thought, ├óÔé¼╦£Dear God, protect as many citizens as you can.├óÔé¼Ôäó It was a nightmare.├óÔé¼┬ØBy 10:30 a.m., America├óÔé¼Ôäós largest city was devastated, its military headquarters were burning. Air force One turned west along the Gulf Coast.├óÔé¼┼ôI can remember sitting right here in this office thinking about the consequences of what had taken place and realizing it was the defining moment in the history of the United States,├óÔé¼┬Ø says President Bush. ├óÔé¼┼ôI didn├óÔé¼Ôäót need any legal briefs, I didn├óÔé¼Ôäót need any consultations, I knew we were at war.├óÔé¼┬ØMr. Bush says the first hours were frustrating. He watched the horrifying pictures, but the TV signal was breaking up. His calls to Cheney were cutting out. Mr. Bush says he pounded his desk shouting, ├óÔé¼┼ôThis is inexcusable, get me the vice president.├óÔé¼┬Ø├óÔé¼┼ôI was trying to clear the fog of war, and there is a fog of war, says the president. Information was just flying from all directions.├óÔé¼┬ØChief of staff Card brought in the reports. There was word Camp David had been hit. A jet was thought to be targeting Mr. Bush├óÔé¼Ôäós ranch.├óÔé¼┼ôI remember hearing that the State Department might have been hit, or that the White House had a fire in it. So we were hearing lots of different information,├óÔé¼┬Ø says Card.They also feared that Air Force One itself was a target. Cheney told the president there was a credible threat against the plane. Using the code name for Air Force One, Mr. Bush told an aide, ├óÔé¼┼ôAngel is next.├óÔé¼┬Ø The threat was passed to presidential pilot Colonel Mark Tillman.├óÔé¼┼ôIt was serious before that but now it is -no longer is it a time to get the president home,├óÔé¼┬Ø Tillman says. ├óÔé¼┼ôWe actually have to consider everything we say, everything we do could be intercepted, and we have to make sure that no one knows what our position is.├óÔé¼┬ØTillman asked for an armed guard at his cockpit door while Secret Service agents double-checked the identity of everyone on board. The crew reviewed the emergency evacuation plan. Then came a warning from air traffic control ├óÔé¼ÔÇ£ a suspect airliner was dead ahead.├óÔé¼┼ôComing out of Sarasota there was one call that said there was an airliner off our nose that they did not have contact with,├óÔé¼┬Ø Tillman remembers.Tillman took evasive action, pulling his plane high above normal traffic. They were on course for Washington, but by now no one thought that was a good idea, except the president.├óÔé¼┼ôI wanted to come back to Washington, but the circumstances were such that it was just impossible for the Secret Service or the national security team to clear the way for Air Force One to come back,├óÔé¼┬Ø says Bush.So Air Force One set course for an underground command center in Nebraska. Back in Washington, the president├óÔé¼Ôäós closest advisor, Karen Hughes, heard about the threat to the plane and placed a call to Mr. Bush.├óÔé¼┼ôAnd the military operator came back to me and in a voice that, to me, sounded very shaken said, ├óÔé¼╦£Ma├óÔé¼Ôäóam, I├óÔé¼Ôäóm sorry, we can├óÔé¼Ôäót reach Air Force One.├óÔé¼Ôäó├óÔé¼┬Ø Hughes recalls. Hughes was out of the White House during the attacks. When she came back, it was a place she didn├óÔé¼Ôäót recognize.├óÔé¼┼ôThere were either military, or maybe Secret Service, dressed all in black, holding machine guns as, as we drove up. And I never expected to see something like that in, in our nation's capital,├óÔé¼┬Ø says Hughes.When she walked into the White House, no one was inside. ├óÔé¼┼ôI knew it was a day that you didn't want to surprise anybody, and so I yelled, ├óÔé¼╦£Hello?├óÔé¼Ôäó and two, again, kind of SWAT team members came running, running through the, the hall with, again, guns drawn, and then took me to, to the location where I met the vice president.├óÔé¼┬ØOn Air Force One, Col. Tillman had a problem. He needed to hide the most visible plane in the world, a 747 longer than the White House itself. He didn├óÔé¼Ôäót want to use his radio, because the hijackers could be listening to air traffic control. So he called air traffic control on the telephone.├óÔé¼┼ôWe actually didn't tell them our destination or what directions we were heading,├óÔé¼┬Ø says Tillman. ├óÔé¼┼ôWe, we basically just talked to 'em and said, 'OK, fine, we have no clearance at this time, we are just going to fly across the United States.'├óÔé¼┬ØControllers passed Air Force One from one sector to another, warning each other to keep the route secret.├óÔé¼┼ôOK, where├óÔé¼Ôäós he going?├óÔé¼┬Ø one tower radioed to another.├óÔé¼┼ôJust watch him,├óÔé¼┬Ø a second tower responded. ├óÔé¼┼ôDon├óÔé¼Ôäót question him where├óÔé¼Ôäós he's going. Just work him and watch him, there├óÔé¼Ôäós no flight plan in and we├óÔé¼Ôäóre not going to put anything in. Ok, sir?├óÔé¼┬ØAir Force One ordered a fighter escort, and air traffic control radioed back: ├óÔé¼┼ôAir Force One, got two F-16s at about your 10 o├óÔé¼Ôäóclock position.├óÔé¼┬Ø├óÔé¼┼ôThe staff, and the president and us, were filed out along the outside hallway of his presidential cabin there and looking out the windows,├óÔé¼┬Ø says Bartlett. ├óÔé¼┼ôAnd the president gives them a signal of salute, and the pilot kind of tips his wing, and fades off and backs into formation.├óÔé¼┬ØThe men in the F-16s were Shane Brotherton and Randy Roberts, from the Texas Air National Guard. Their mission was so secret their commander wouldn├óÔé¼Ôäót tell them where they were going.├óÔé¼┼ôHe just said, 'You├óÔé¼Ôäóll know when you see it,' and that was my first clue, I didn├óÔé¼Ôäót have any idea what we were going up until that point,├óÔé¼┬Ø says Brotherton. He knew when he saw it.├óÔé¼┼ôWe, we were trying to keep an 80-mile bubble, bubble around Air Force One, and we'd investigate anything that was within 80 miles,├óÔé¼┬Ø says Roberts.Bush says he was not worried about the safety of the people on this aircraft, or for his own safety: ├óÔé¼┼ôI looked out the airplane and saw two F-16s on each wing. It was going to have to be a pretty good pilot to get us.├óÔé¼┬ØWe now know that the threat to Air Force One was part of the fog of war, a false alarm. But it had a powerful effect at the time. Some wondered, with the president out of sight, was he still running the government? He hadn├óÔé¼Ôäót appeared after the attack on Washington. Mr. Bush was clearly worried about it. At one point he was overheard saying, ├óÔé¼┼ôThe American people want to know where their dang president is.├óÔé¼┬Ø The staff considered an address to the nation by phone but instead Mr. Bush ordered Air Force One to land somewhere within 30 minutes so he could appear on TV. At 11:45 a.m., they landed at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana.├óÔé¼┼ôThe resolve of our great nation is being tested. But make no mistake, we will show the world that we will pass this test. God bless,├óÔé¼┬Ø Bush said to the nation from Barksdale.At Barksdale, the Secret Service believed the situation in Washington was still unsafe. So the plane continued on to Nebraska, to the command center where Mr. Bush would be secure and have all the communications gear he needed to run the government. Aboard Air Force One, Mr. Bush had a job for press secretary Fleischer.├óÔé¼┼ôThe president asked me to make sure that I took down everything that was said. I think he wanted to make certain that a record existed,├óÔé¼┬Ø says FleischerFleischer├óÔé¼Ôäós notes capture Mr. Bush├óÔé¼Ôäós language, plain and unguarded. To the vice president he said: ├óÔé¼┼ôWe├óÔé¼Ôäóre at war, Dick, we├óÔé¼Ôäóre going to find out who did this and kick their ass.├óÔé¼┬Ø Another time, Mr. Bush said, ├óÔé¼┼ôWe├óÔé¼Ôäóre not going to have any slap-on-the-wrist crap this time.├óÔé¼┬ØThe President adds, ├óÔé¼┼ôI can remember telling the Secretary of Defense, I said, ├óÔé¼╦£We├óÔé¼Ôäóre going to find out who did this and then Mr. Secretary, you and Dick Myers,├óÔé¼Ôäó who we just named as chairman of the joint chiefs, ├óÔé¼╦£are going to go get them.├óÔé¼Ôäó├óÔé¼┬ØBy 3 p.m., Air Force One touched down at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska. Mr. Bush and his team were herded into a small brick hut that gave no hint of what they would find below.At the bottom of the stairs was the U.S. Strategic Command Underground Command Center. It was built to transmit a president├óÔé¼Ôäós order to go to nuclear war. But when Mr. Bush walked in, the battle staff was watching the skies over the United States. Many airplanes had still not landed. After a short briefing, Mr. Bush and Card were taken to a teleconference center which connected them to the White House, the Pentagon, the FBI and the CIA. Mr. Bush had a question for his CIA Director George Tenent.According to Rice, Bush asked Tenent who had done this. Rice recalls that Tenent answered: ├óÔé¼┼ôSir, I believe its al Qaeda. We├óÔé¼Ôäóre doing the assessment but it looks like, it feels like, it smells like al Qaeda.├óÔé¼┬ØThe evidence would build. FBI Director Robert Mueller says that an essential clue came from one of the hijacked planes before it crashed.A flight attendant on American Flight 11, Amy Sweeney, had the presence of mind to call her office as the plane was hijacked and give them the seat numbers of the hijackers. ├óÔé¼┼ôThat was the first piece of hard evidence. We could then go to the manifest, find out who was sitting in those seats and immediately conduct an investigation of those individuals, as opposed to taking all the passengers on the plane and going through a process of elimination,├óÔé¼┬Ø says Mueller.In Nebraska, the White House staff was preparing for an address to the nation from the Air Force bunker, but by then the president had had enough. He decided to come back.├óÔé¼┼ôAt one point, he said he didn├óÔé¼Ôäót want any tinhorn terrorist keeping him out of Washington,├óÔé¼┬Ø Fleischer says. ├óÔé¼┼ôThat verbatim.├óÔé¼┬ØOn board, he was already thinking of issuing an ultimatum to the world: ├óÔé¼┼ôI had time to think and a couple of thoughts emerged. One was that you're guilty if you harbor a terrorist, because I knew these terrorists like al-Qaeda liked to prey on weak government and weak people. The other thought that came was the opportunity to fashion a vast coalition of countries that would either be with us or with the terrorists.├óÔé¼┬ØAs Air Force One sped east, the last casualty of the attack on America collapsed, one of the nation├óÔé¼Ôäós worst days wore into evening. At the World Trade Center, 2,801 were killed, at the Pentagon, 184, and in Pennsylvania 40. Altogether, there were 3,025 dead.├óÔé¼┼ôAnybody who would attack America the way they did, anybody who would take innocent life the way they did, anybody who's so devious, is evil,├óÔé¼┬Ø Bush said recently.Mr. Bush would soon see that evil face to face. After arriving in Washington, he boarded his helicopter and flew past the Pentagon on the way to the White House.Was there a time when he was afraid that there might not be a White House to return to? ├óÔé¼┼ôI don├óÔé¼Ôäót remember thinking about whether or not the White House would have been obliterated, he recalls. I think I might have thought they took their best shot, and now it was time for us to take our best shot.├óÔé¼┬ØMr. Bush arrived back at the White House nine hours after the attacks. His next step was an address to the nation. Karen Hughes and her staff were already working on the speech.├óÔé¼┼ôHe decided that the primary tone he wanted to strike that night was reassurance,├óÔé¼┬Ø remembers Hughes. ├óÔé¼┼ôWe had to show resolve, we had to reassure people, we had to let them know that we would be OK.├óÔé¼┬ØJust off the Oval Office, Mr. Bush added the words that would become known as the Bush Doctrine - no distinction between terrorists and those who harbor them. The staff wanted to add a declaration of war but Mr. Bush didn├óÔé¼Ôäót think the American people wanted to hear it that night and he was emphatic about that.He prepared to say it from the same desk where Franklin Roosevelt first heard the news of Pearl Harbor. Now Bush was commander in chief. Eighty million Americans were watching.├óÔé¼┼ôToday our fellow citizens, our way of life, our very freedom came under attack in a series of deliberate and deadly terrorist acts,├óÔé¼┬Ø he said from the Oval Office that night.The Oval Office speech came at the end of the bloodiest day in American history since the Civil War. Before he walked to the White House residence for the night, Mr. Bush dictated these words for the White House daily log: ├óÔé¼┼ôThe Pearl Harbor of the 21st century took place today. We think it's Osama bin Laden.├óÔé¼┬Ø(CBS)├é┬áWhen Sept. 12 dawned, President Bush was demanding a war plan. No one in the White House or the Pentagon could be sure of what the president would do. In office for just eight months, he├óÔé¼Ôäód never been tested as commander-in-chief.├óÔé¼┼ôI never asked them what they thought,├óÔé¼┬Ø President Bush said of the Pentagon brass, ├óÔé¼┼ôbecause I didn├óÔé¼Ôäót really ├óÔé¼ÔÇ£ because I knew what I was gonna do. I knew exactly what had to be done, Scott. And that was to set a strategy to seek justice. Find out who did it, hunt them down and bring them to justice.├óÔé¼┬ØIn the cabinet room, the president made clear what was next: ├óÔé¼┼ôThe deliberate and deadly attacks which were carried out yesterday against our country were more than acts of terror, they were acts of war,├óÔé¼┬Ø he said.To the war cabinet, al Qaeda was no surprise. National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice says the administration had been at work on a plan to strike bin Laden├óÔé¼Ôäós organization well before Sept. 11.├óÔé¼┼ôThe president said, ├óÔé¼╦£You know I├óÔé¼Ôäóm tired of swatting at flies, I need a strategy to eliminate these guys,├óÔé¼Ôäó├óÔé¼┬Ø Rice recalls.In one of the worst intelligence failures ever, the CIA and FBI didn├óÔé¼Ôäót pick up clues that an attack in the United States was imminent. Without a sense of urgency, the White House strategy the president had asked for came too late.Chief of Staff Andrew Card recalls that the plan Mr. Bush had asked for was ├óÔé¼┼ôliterally headed to the president├óÔé¼Ôäós desk, I think, on the eleventh, tenth or eleventh, of September.├óÔé¼┬ØOn Sept. 12, the war cabinet was debating the full range of options - who to hit and how to hit them. There were some at the Pentagon who worried in the early hours that Mr. Bush would order up an immediate cruise missile strike, of the kind that had not deterred bin Laden in the past.├óÔé¼┼ôWell, there├óÔé¼Ôäós a lot of nervous Nellies at the Pentagon, anyway,├óÔé¼┬Ø Mr. Bush tells Pelley. ├óÔé¼┼ôA lot of people like to chatter, you know, more than they should. But no, I appreciate that very much. Secretary of Defense (Donald) Rumsfeld early on discussed the idea of making sure we had what we called ├óÔé¼╦£boots on the ground.├óÔé¼Ôäó That if you├óÔé¼Ôäóre gonna go to war, then you├óÔé¼Ôäóve gotta go to war with all your assets.├óÔé¼┬ØThe president says he wanted to ├óÔé¼┼ôfight and win a guerilla war with conventional means.├óÔé¼┬ØIt was an innovative but risky idea being proposed by CIA Director George Tenent. Tenent wanted to combine American technology and intelligence with the brute force of Afghan fighters hostile to the Taliban government.Secretary of State Colin Powell, noting that the CIA had already developed a long relationship with the Afghan resistance, called it an unconventional solution to an unconventional problem.├óÔé¼┼ôAs I like to describe it to my friends,├óÔé¼┬Ø Powell says, ├óÔé¼┼ôwe had on the ground a Fourth World army riding horses and living in tents with some CIA and special forces with them and we had a First World air force, the best in the world. How do you connect it all?├óÔé¼┬ØThe president gave them 48 hours to figure it out.Meanwhile, Mr. Bush went to the battlefield himself. Just the day before, he had called the Pentagon the ├óÔé¼┼ômightiest building in the world.├óÔé¼┬Ø Now one-fifth of it was in ruins. The wreckage of American Flight 77 was being examined by Navy investigators. And before Mr. Bush left, he made a point of speaking personally with the team recovering the remains of the first casualties of war on his watch.The next day, Sept. 13, there was another warning of attack that the public never heard about. Threats had been were coming in constantly but this one sounded credible: a large truck bomb headed to the White House. The Secret Service wanted the president back in the bunker.├óÔé¼┼ôHe wasn├óÔé¼Ôäót real receptive to that, to that recommendation,├óÔé¼┬Ø remembers Brian Stafford, director of the Secret Service. ├óÔé¼┼ôAnd he ordered a hamburger and said he was going to stay in the White House that evening and that├óÔé¼Ôäós what he did.├óÔé¼┬ØThe next day, would be one of the longest and the most difficult for the president. On Friday, Sept. 14, Mr. Bush started the day with a cabinet meeting, but he wept when he walked in and was surprised by applause.├óÔé¼┼ôHe sat down, slightly overcome, for a moment but he recaptured it,├óÔé¼┬Ø says Powell who remembers being worried that the president might have trouble getting through his speech at the national memorial service later that morning.├óÔé¼┼ôAnd I just scribbled a little note to him,├óÔé¼┬Ø Powell recalls, ├óÔé¼┼ôand I said, ├óÔé¼╦£Mr. President, I├óÔé¼Ôäóve learned over the years when you are going to give a very emotional speech, watch out for certain words that will cause you to start to tear up.├óÔé¼Ôäó He looked at me and he smiled and then at the next break in the conversation he said, ├óÔé¼╦£The Secretary of State told me not to break down at the memorial service,├óÔé¼Ôäó and that broke the tension and everybody started laughing and I felt embarrassed.├óÔé¼┬ØFirst Lady Laura Bush was involved in planning the memorial service and she says she wanted it to be both dignified and comforting. ├óÔé¼┼ôI wanted the Psalms and everything to be read to be comforting, because I think we were a country, that needed, everyone of us, needed comforting.├óÔé¼┬ØIt also stirred the mourners├óÔé¼Ôäó resolve, as Rice remember. ├óÔé¼┼ôAs we stood to sing the Battle Hymn of the Republic,├óÔé¼┬Ø she says, ├óÔé¼┼ôyou could feel the entire congregation and I could certainly feel myself stiffen, the kind of spine, and this deep sadness was being replaced by resolve.├óÔé¼┼ôWe all felt that we still had mourning to do for our countrymen who had been lost but that we also had a new purpose in not just avenging what had happened to them but making certain that the world was eventually going to be safe from this kind of attack ever again.├óÔé¼┬ØNext came a visit to ground zero. The president was not prepared for what he encountered there.├óÔé¼┼ôYou couldn├óÔé¼Ôäót brief me, you couldn├óÔé¼Ôäót brief anybody on ground zero until you saw it, Mr. Bush says. ├óÔé¼┼ôIt was like ├óÔé¼ÔÇ£ it was ghostly. Like you├óÔé¼Ôäóre having a bad dream and you├óÔé¼Ôäóre walking through the dream.├óÔé¼┬ØThe president found the scene very powerful, particularly when the men and women at ground zero began to chant, ├óÔé¼┼ôUSA! USA!.├óÔé¼┬Ø├óÔé¼┼ôThere was a lot of bloodlust,├óÔé¼┬Ø the president recalls. ├óÔé¼┼ôPeople were, you know, pointing their big old hands at me saying, ├óÔé¼╦£Don├óÔé¼Ôäót you ever forget this, Mr. President. Don├óÔé¼Ôäót let us down.├óÔé¼Ôäó The scene was very powerful. Very powerful.├óÔé¼┬ØWhen Mr. Bush tried to speak, the crowd kept shouting, ├óÔé¼┼ôWe can├óÔé¼Ôäót hear you.├óÔé¼┬ØThe president responded, ├óÔé¼┼ôI can hear you. I can hear you. The rest of the world hears you. And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon.├óÔé¼┬ØMr. Bush had been in New York just a few weeks before, he├óÔé¼Ôäód posed with the firemen who always stood by whenever the president├óÔé¼Ôäós helicopter landed there. Now, five of the men who stood with the president in the picture were dead ├óÔé¼ÔÇ£ lost at ground zero.When the president arrived Sept. 14, Manhattan was papered with the faces of the lost. Families, unable to believe that so many had vanished in an instant, held onto the hope that their loved ones were just missing. It was a place where a child comforted a grieving mother.At a meeting the public never saw, the president spoke with several hundred of these families in a convention hall.├óÔé¼┼ôPeople said to me, ├óÔé¼╦£He├óÔé¼Ôäóll come out. Don├óÔé¼Ôäót worry, Mr. president, we├óÔé¼Ôäóll see him soon. I know my loved one, he will - he├óÔé¼Ôäóll find a place to survive underneath the rubble and we├óÔé¼Ôäóll get him out.├óÔé¼Ôäó I, on the other hand had been briefed about the realities, and my job was to hug and cry, but I remember the whole time thinking, ├óÔé¼╦£This is incredibly sad because the loved ones won├óÔé¼Ôäót come out.├óÔé¼Ôäó├óÔé¼┬ØOne little boy handed the president a picture of his father in his firefighter uniform and as he signed it, Mr. Bush remembers, he told the boy, ├óÔé¼┼ôYour daddy won├óÔé¼Ôäót believe that I was here, so you show him that autograph.├óÔé¼┬ØIt was an effort ├óÔé¼┼ôto provide a little hope,├óÔé¼┬Ø the president recalls. ├óÔé¼┼ôI still get emotional thinking about it because we├óÔé¼Ôäóre dealing with people who loved their dads or loved their mom, or loved their├óÔé¼┬ªwives who loved their husbands. It was a tough time, you know, it was a tough time for all of us because we were a very emotional, and I was emotional at times. I felt, I felt the same now as I did then, which is sad. And I still feel sad for those who grieve for their families, but through my tears, I see opportunity.├óÔé¼┬ØThe president was supposed to be with the families for about 30 minutes, he stayed for two and a half hours. It was there he met Arlene Howard. The body of her son, George, was among the first to be found at ground zero.├óÔé¼┼ôI called the police department,├óÔé¼┬Ø Howard remembers, ├óÔé¼┼ô and they said he hadn├óÔé¼Ôäót called in for roll call and to call back in an hour and I said, ├óÔé¼╦£No, I don├óÔé¼Ôäót need to call back.├óÔé¼Ôäó If he hadn├óÔé¼Ôäót called in, I knew where he was.├óÔé¼┬ØGeorge Howard had rescued children trapped in an elevator back in 1993 when the World Trade Center was bombed. He had been off duty that day, and he was off duty on Sept. 11, but couldn├óÔé¼Ôäót stay away. The police department gave his badge to his mother and she gave it to the president.├óÔé¼┼ôHe (the president) he leaned over to talk to me,├óÔé¼┬Ø Howard recalls. ├óÔé¼┼ôAnd he extends his sympathy to me and that├óÔé¼Ôäós wh"

' s disclosure that it may have to repay a $ 690 million note next week following the downgrade of its credit ratings to the lowest investment - grade level . the houston - based energy trader made the disclosure in a filing with the securities and exchange commission known as a ` ` 10 q ' ' on monday . ` ` i have to believe that dynegy knew about this , maybe not when the deal was signed , but certainly before the 10 q was published . there was wiggle room in the deal for both write downs , which effectively includes both the note and the potential write down for whitewing . ' ' ` ` there still appears to be enough liquidity to handle the write offs and the $ 690 million limited partnership note . ' ' ` ` over the short - run , the rest of this week , it is going to be difficult for anyone to trade with enron , because they should be generally concerned that neither enron nor dynegy has made public comments on this 10 q . ' ' ` ` if it is only for a few days , we ' re ok . as long as dynegy doesn ' t pull out of this deal , we should be ok , and enron should maintain its investment grade rating , and all the enron corp . bonds should mature without incident . ' ' ` ` hopefully the company will comment shortly . if there has ever been a company that couldn ' t afford to disclose a time bomb in a 10 q , it is enron . this should have been disclosed prior to this . it added to the crisis of confidence . ' ' ` ` we believe the company will be able to satisfy the $ 690 million note . it appears they should be able to do it from existing liquidity . they could renegotiate the note and / or the other bank facilities that would be jeopardized if they default on the note . ' ' ` ` even our buy recommendation on the enron notes is based on our belief that dynegy ' s management is credible because enron ' s lost all credibility with this disclosure . ' ' on the possibility that enron may be downgraded to junk ratings : ` ` nothing ' s too big to fail , and pg & e proved that . the core business at enron is the trading operation , and it is difficult for people to trade with any firm , particularly an energy trader , if there is any concern they won ' t be able to deliver on their side of the trade . ' ' enron stock punishment deepens debt woes cast pall over merger by tom fowler copyright 2001 houston chronicle november 21 , 2001 the continuing stream of surprises from the depths of enron corp . ' s balance sheet is putting a strain on dynegy ' s plans to buy its beleaguered competitor , but analysts say the deal remains on track . enron ' s share price dropped 23 percent tuesday to $ 6 . 99 after news the company had to restate its third - quarter earnings and would need to pay off or renegotiate a $ 690 million iou by monday . the changes came just five days after enron executives told analysts in a conference call they believed most of the charges related to special financing partnerships had been disclosed .  the fact that enron is still capable of pulling new rabbits out of their hat would make me think dynegy would question their future earnings even more ,  said prudential securities analyst carol coale , referring to the big income benefit dynegy hopes to reap from the deal .  but at this point dynegy says they ' re still going forward , so i still have a positive outlook on it closing .  the $ 690 million note payable , which is related to a natural gas partnership in brazil , had been reported earlier . but the fact that it would come due almost immediately if the company ' s credit rating was downgraded to bbb - , which happened nov . 12 , was news to analysts and to dynegy . enron spokesman mark palmer said the company has the cash on hand to pay the obligation but would like to have it restructured and extended . negotiations are under way to do so , he said . the surprise surrounding the early deadline for the note was likely because of high turnover in enron ' s accounting department , said merrill lynch analyst donato eassey in a report tuesday , but he believes the debt was taken into account by dynegy in merger negotiations .  the latest twists , while negative , are not however likely to turn into a tornado and are not deal - breakers in our opinion ,  eassey said .  at the level enron is being purchased , dynegy had clearly baked - in these types of uncertainties into its purchase price .  enron is also feeling pressure because some of its energy trading partners are either cutting back on the amount of business they do with the company or keeping close watch of enron ' s credit rating . officials with mirant corp . and aquila said they have cut back on trading while houston - based reliant resources is watching the situation carefully .  we ' re being cautious , monitoring our position with them very closely ,  said joe bob perkins , president of reliant resources ' wholesale business .  but i don ' t think that today feels significantly different than it felt a week ago .  perkins said reliant officials read enron ' s 10 - q filing .  the questions we had about that we addressed with enron ,  perkins said . he said the fuss over the 10 - q seemed to be coming more from the press than the energy trading industry and said any slowdown in overall trading in the market may have more to do with the season than problems at enron .  it looks more like the preholiday norm than anything fundamentally different because of enron ,  perkins said . that doesn ' t mean analysts are resting easy . commerzbank securities analyst andre meade said in a report that although the 10 - q sheds more light on enron finances , the information continues to be released piecemeal , making it likely more surprises are in store .  overall we believe the filing clearly shows that enron remains in a precarious financial position , and its status as a going concern is much in doubt ,  meade said . enron has about $ 1 . 5 billion in cash and about $ 3 billion in recently negotiated revolving credit lines , as well as $ 800 million in asset sales pending and another $ 500 million to $ 1 billion in equity investment expected soon . that could disappear in a hurry , however , if the company ' s credit rating drops one notch to below - investment grade . that would trigger several partnership contracts that would force the company to repay or refinance up to $ 4 billion in debt . credit rating agency standard & poor ' s said tuesday it was maintaining enron ' s rating , but prudential ' s coale is concerned .  the real crisis is in six months , when almost $ 4 billion in debt is expected to mature ,  she said .  it ' s not fatalistic , but it is dire .  watchdog group nixes request to probe enron audit woes by judith burns of dow jones newswires 11 / 21 / 2001 dow jones news service ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones judith . burns @ dowjones . com copyright ?

' s plan to purchase enron for around $ 10 - billion in stock , bond prices had firmed to above 80 cents on the dollar . yesterday , a dynegy spokesman wouldn ' t comment on the status of the pending acquisition , other than to say his company was reviewing enron ' s third - quarter financial report , filed with the sec , as part of continuing  due diligence .  under the proposed acquisition , dynegy would exchange 0 . 2685 of its shares for each enron share . based on dynegy ' s 4 p . m . price yesterday of $ 41 . 70 a share , off $ 1 . 90 , the deal values enron shares at about $ 11 . 20 - - well above the current market price . monday ' s third - quarter financial report from enron , which supplemented and revised enron ' s earnings announcement last month , reinforced fears that the energy - trading company is  in precarious financial position and will be for awhile ,  said andre meade , head of u . s . utility research at commerzbank securities . enron ' s sec filing said that because of the company ' s deteriorated credit standing it might have to come up with $ 690 - million later his month to honour a collateral call on a note outstanding . the filing also said enron might be forced to take a $ 700 - million pretax charge to earnings in the current quarter , ending dec . 31 , due to a drop in value of some of its assets . houston - based enron has been in deepening financial distress for the past month , since announcing big asset and shareholder equity reductions in the third quarter . much of the turmoil has been caused by the company ' s dealings with partnerships headed by former enron officers , including its former chief financial officer . those dealings part of a formal sec investigation . how well , or poorly , enron ' s energy trading volume holds up is  the million - dollar question ,  said simmons & co . analyst jeff dietert . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . front page - companies & markets - new fears over dynegy bid hit enron . by robert clow , andrew hill and sheila mcnulty . 11 / 21 / 2001 financial times ( c ) 2001 financial times limited . all rights reserved fears that dynegy may not be able to complete its rescue bid for enron in time to save the rival energy group hit enron ' s shares and bonds yesterday , as investors limited their exposure ahead of tomorrow ' s thanksgiving holiday . the stock fell 23 per cent , or $ 2 . 07 , to close at $ 6 . 99 in new york after enron disclosed in a regulatory filing in which the group said it would have to repay $ 9 . 15 bn of debt by the end of next year .  the filing shows , in our view , enron remains in a pretty precarious position . . . i am not convinced enron can raise enough money to fill those obligations prior to the close with dynegy ,  said andre meade , an analyst with commerzbank securities . growing doubts about the chances of the $ 9 . 6 bn deal going through have widened the spread between the enron share price and the value of dynegy ' s all - stock bid . by the close in new york yesterday enron ' s shares were trading at a discount of 38 per cent to the offer . dynegy would say only that the filing was an  important step  in the due diligence process it is carrying out . enron warned in monday ' s filing that last week ' s credit rating downgrade by standard & poor ' s would trigger the repayment on november 27 of a $ 690 m note , unless it posted collateral . enron is talking to its lenders to avoid , or delay , repayment . s & p said yesterday it believed enron ' s net available cash of $ 1 . 5 bn , plus an expected $ 500 m of additional private equity and $ 800 m of asset sale proceeds , would be enough to carry it through to completion of the dynegy takeover . but the agency kept the company on a negative  creditwatch  - meaning its rating could still be cut to junk . merrill lynch estimated that enron had burnt through $ 5 bn of cash in just 50 days . officials from dynegy and enron have estimated that it could take six to nine months for the takeover to be approved . if enron fails , it would have grave repercussions for the energy and financial markets .  enron is essentially insolvent without dynegy , so it needs the deal to go through ,  said curt launer , an analyst with credit suisse first boston , who believes there is still a 90 per cent chance of the dynegy deal succeeding . the company ' s bonds traded as low as 50 cents on the dollar yesterday although a distressed investor , wilbur ross - who runs wl ross & co - said that his firm was buying the bonds because the market had overreacted . additional reporting by robert clow avenue of the americas , page 13 www . ft . com / enron .

' s balance sheet is putting a strain on dynegy ' s plans to buy its beleaguered competitor , but analysts say the deal remains on track . enron ' s share price dropped 23 percent tuesday to $ 6 . 99 after news the company had to restate its third - quarter earnings and would need to pay off or renegotiate a $ 690 million iou by monday . the changes came just five days after enron executives told analysts in a conference call they believed most of the charges related to special financing partnerships had been disclosed .  the fact that enron is still capable of pulling new rabbits out of their hat would make me think dynegy would question their future earnings even more ,  said prudential securities analyst carol coale , referring to the big income benefit dynegy hopes to reap from the deal .  but at this point dynegy says they ' re still going forward , so i still have a positive outlook on it closing .  the $ 690 million note payable , which is related to a natural gas partnership in brazil , had been reported earlier . but the fact that it would come due almost immediately if the company ' s credit rating was downgraded to bbb - , which happened nov . 12 , was news to analysts and to dynegy . enron spokesman mark palmer said the company has the cash on hand to pay the obligation but would like to have it restructured and extended . negotiations are under way to do so , he said . the surprise surrounding the early deadline for the note was likely because of high turnover in enron ' s accounting department , said merrill lynch analyst donato eassey in a report tuesday , but he believes the debt was taken into account by dynegy in merger negotiations .  the latest twists , while negative , are not however likely to turn into a tornado and are not deal - breakers in our opinion ,  eassey said .  at the level enron is being purchased , dynegy had clearly baked - in these types of uncertainties into its purchase price .  enron is also feeling pressure because some of its energy trading partners are either cutting back on the amount of business they do with the company or keeping close watch of enron ' s credit rating . officials with mirant corp . and aquila said they have cut back on trading while houston - based reliant resources is watching the situation carefully .  we ' re being cautious , monitoring our position with them very closely ,  said joe bob perkins , president of reliant resources ' wholesale business .  but i don ' t think that today feels significantly different than it felt a week ago .  perkins said reliant officials read enron ' s 10 - q filing .  the questions we had about that we addressed with enron ,  perkins said . he said the fuss over the 10 - q seemed to be coming more from the press than the energy trading industry and said any slowdown in overall trading in the market may have more to do with the season than problems at enron .  it looks more like the preholiday norm than anything fundamentally different because of enron ,  perkins said . that doesn ' t mean analysts are resting easy . commerzbank securities analyst andre meade said in a report that although the 10 - q sheds more light on enron finances , the information continues to be released piecemeal , making it likely more surprises are in store .  overall we believe the filing clearly shows that enron remains in a precarious financial position , and its status as a going concern is much in doubt ,  meade said . enron has about $ 1 . 5 billion in cash and about $ 3 billion in recently negotiated revolving credit lines , as well as $ 800 million in asset sales pending and another $ 500 million to $ 1 billion in equity investment expected soon . that could disappear in a hurry , however , if the company ' s credit rating drops one notch to below - investment grade . that would trigger several partnership contracts that would force the c"

' s credit and debt ratings have fallen to junk status , crippling what once was the largest u . s . energy trader , observers are pointing fingers , and wondering what took the top three u . s . credit rating agencies so long to act .  the rating agencies are at fault here for waiting so long and thinking they could hold the deal together ,  said tom burnett , a director of merger insight , a research and analysis firm .  that ' s not their job . there ' s not one new piece of information available today that wasn ' t available last week .  the agencies - standard & poor ' s , moody ' s investors service and fitch - denied being influenced to keep enron ' s once investment - grade ratings , or they declined to discuss the issue . observers , though , said investment banks arranging enron ' s now - dissolved merger with once - smaller rival dynegy inc . - citigroup inc . and j . p . morgan chase & co . - had been fighting to preserve those ratings . they now stand to lose millions of dollars of advisory fees with the merger ' s collapse .  s & p and moody ' s have stated that they ' re not going to be the cause of problems for a company , and in my opinion waited until dynegy decided not to proceed with the merger ,  said sean egan , managing director at egan - jones ratings co . in philadelphia . egan - jones on wednesday cut its own debt rating for enron to  c ,  one notch above default . anger grows prices on enron ' s distressed bonds had been in a tailspin for several sessions , and after wednesday ' s cuts they fell by more than half . traders bid them on wednesday near 25 cents on the dollar , with often triple - digit yields .  i do get the feeling there is a lot of anger and feeling that something should have occurred before  wednesday , said mary ann hurley , vice president of fixed - income trading at d . a . davidson in seattle .  there was talk in the markets that the absence of official statements from dynegy and enron ( on ) tuesday should have been taken by the rating agencies as a clue that the merger was about to fall apart .  that happened on wednesday . within about a two - hour period , the rating agencies cut their senior unsecured debt ratings for enron - to  b - minus  by s & p , to  b 2  by moody ' s , and to  cc  by fitch . almost simultaneous with the fitch downgrade , dynegy announced it had backed out of the $ 9 billion merger . the three big rating agencies are paid by companies to assess their ability to repay debt . many companies need these ratings to raise money from investors . sometimes , though , the agencies face criticism for being too slow to act , or being susceptible to outside pressure . indeed , in january they were criticized for waiting for actual defaults before downgrading california utilities pacific gas & electric co . and southern california edison to junk status . role of agencies with regard to the proposed enron - dynegy merger , on nov . 8 , a day before the merger was announced , top citigroup and j . p . morgan officials met with moody ' s , a person familiar with the meeting said . a day later , moody ' s cut enron ' s rating , but not to junk . john diaz , a moody ' s managing director , denied facing new pressures this week .  in any rating activity , we ' re discussing developments with the companies , so we ' ve been in touch with the companies as we normally would do ,  he said .  we have not had contact with the banks .  ron barone , an s & p director , denied getting pressure from banks this week to hold off on a rating downgrade .  none whatsoever ,  he said in a conference call .  no substance at all . we have not been in contact with the banks .  meanwhile , glen grabelsky , a senior director in fitch ' s policy group , said  our conversations with the issuers and the agents are confidential .  diaz and grabelsky said their respective agencies did not decide until wednesday morning to downgrade enron .  there wasn ' t one specific event to trigger the downgrade ,  said diaz .  in the last couple of days our concerns were heightened given the rate of erosion of the ( enron ) franchise , and the declining probability the merger would be consummated as originally expected .  grabelsky said :  when we lost confidence in the transaction , that ' s when we started preparing to notify the markets .  d . a . davidson ' s hurley said the delays could be understandable .  given that the merger or buyout by dynegy wasn ' t officially called off  until wednesday , she said ,  it would have been really hard for the rating agencies to move ( enron ) to junk status when there was a buyout that was pending .

it was an around - the - clock system . that is going to dry up ,  a new york broker said . houston - based enron said it indefinitely suspended future operation of enrononline on wednesday . u . s . and european traders said it closed down shortly after standard & poor ' s cut the financially troubled houston -

settled trading in gold , silver , energy and power products , said ice would accommodate customers if they demanded trading in base metals products .  if after - hours trading in ( base ) metals is something that their customers want to see on the ice system , then they ' ll look into seeing how they can implement it ,  the spokesperson for atlanta -

enron corp . , once the champion of energy deregulation , has fallen victim to the very volatility that often accompanies the transition from an orderly , regulated marketplace to one that follows the harsh laws of supply and demand . enron , until recently the nation ' s largest energy trader , stood at the brink of one of the biggest corporate collapses in u . s . history on wednesday as its rescue by rival dynegy inc . fell apart .  enron is in some ways the victim of its own success ,  said gerald keenan , lead energy strategy partner at pwc consulting , part of .  all this wouldn ' t have occured if the market wasn ' t deregulated .  enron was one of the earliest and most aggressive advocates of power deregulation , which breaks down traditional utility monopolies by letting customers choose their electricity provider , banking on competition to drive down prices . its aggressive strategies gave enron 20 percent of the north american electricity and natural gas market , and enron was ranked no . 7 on fortune magazine ' s list of the biggest u . s . companies . the downfall but in recent weeks , enron ' s credit and debt spiralled out of control as a series of partnerships designed to hide debt off of its balance sheet caused its investors to lose faith . the partnerships , which included top enron executives , are the subject of a u . s . securities and exchange investigation . in a fluid , competitive marketplace , punishment comes quickly . enron ' s share price closed at 61 cents on wednesday , down $ 3 . 53 , or 85 percent , from a peak of over $ 90 in august 2000 , after the top three u . s . rating agenices downgraded enron to junk status .  there are winners and losers in deregulated markets and people who champion them are not necessarily those who will be around in the end ,  keenan said . as more business and mounting profits fell into enron ' s hands , the company took on a air of invicibility . despised by some market players , many of its trading partners nevertheless were willing to go out on a limb because of enron ' s good reputation , smart traders , and high - flying share price . enron ' s core business of trading electricity and natural gas relies highly on creditworthiness , and much of its trading was backed by a corporate guarantee , a kind of standby iou . once that credit guarantee began to be be doubted , credit managers pulled the fire alarm and reduced their exposure .  up to about two months ago , an enron corporate guarantee was seen by many as money in the bank . then the whole house of cards came down ,  keenan said . people began looking at enron more closely , especially since october when a series of negative disclosures about the company ' s finances forced the company to lower its reported earnings by $ 600 million over the last four years as a result of questionable off - balance sheet transactions . enron ' s trading business - its crown jewel - has also suffered from lower volumes as wary trading partners shifted business away from the cash - poor and credit - threatened enron . what now ? if enron ' s fallout has a significant affect on the regulated companies it did business with , regulators and policymakers could slow down the pace of power deregulation . but if the damage is confined to the wholesale trading market , there will not be as much impact , analysts said . so far , 23 states and the district of columbia have moved to deregulate their retail power markets , although nearly one third of them have delayed the onset of competition partly due to california ' s failed free market experiment . analysts also said if enron is no longer a major player in the large customer market , where it has been very effective , deregulation is not likely to proceed as quickly .  it ' s a perception issue . enron ' s struggle may have adverse consequences on retail choice even though it has very little to do with it ,  said sharon reishus , an associate director of north american power at cambridge energy research associates ( cera ) , an independent research firm based in cambridge , massachusetts .  this puts us more into the muddle of whether deregulation is good or not .  copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . usa : northwest natural files to acquire enron utility . 11 / 28 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . salem , ore . , nov 28 ( reuters ) -

I was shocked. What about Gettysburg and the Declaration of Independence and the Selma-to-Montgomery march? Just look at my textbook, he said, and when I did I saw his point. His class had got up to the eighteen-forties. What I expected was a big beefing up of the roles of Sacagawea and Crispus Attucks, and, in-deed, there was some of that. But the main difference between my son's text and that of my own childhood was that somebody had made the disastrous decision to devote most of it to what had actually happened in American history. There were pages and pages on tariffs and bank charters and reciprocal trade agreements. I skipped ahead, past the Civil War, hoping for easier going, only to encounter currency floats and the regulation of freight rates. Only a few decades into the twentieth century did it become possible to see the federal government's main function as responding to dramatic crises and launching crusades for social justice, instead of attempting to referee competing claims from economic interests.Even now, if one were to reveal what really goes on behind the pretty speeches and the sanctimonious hearings in Washington, what you'd find is thousands of lawyers and lobbyists madly vying for advantage, not so much over the public as over each other: agribusiness versus real estate, banks versus insurance companies, and so on. The arena in which this competition mainly takes place is regulatory agencies and commissions and the congressional committees that supervise them. It's an insider's game, less because the players are secretive than because the public and the press├óÔé¼ÔÇØencouraged by the players, who speak in jargon├óÔé¼ÔÇØcan't get themselves interested.One corner of Washington might be called F.C.C. World, for the Federal Communications Commission. F.C.C. World has perhaps five thousand denizens. They work at the commission itself, at the House and Senate commerce committees, and at the Washington offices of the companies that the commission regulates. They read Communications Daily (subscription price: $3,695 a year), and every year around Christmastime they grumblingly attend the Chairman's Dinner, at a Washington hotel, where the high point of the evening is a scripted, supposedly self-deprecating comedy routine by the commission's chairman.Of all the federal agencies and commissions, the F.C.C. is the one that Americans ought to be most interested in, after all, it is involved with a business sector that accounts for about fifteen per cent of the American economy, as well as important aspects of daily life├óÔé¼ÔÇØtelephone and television and radio and newspapers and the Internet. And right now F.C.C. World is in, if not a crisis, at least a very soapy lather, because a good portion of what the angry public thinks of as the corporate scandals concerns the economic collapse of companies regulated by the F.C.C. Qwest, WorldCom, Adelphia, and Global Crossing, among others, are (or were) part of F.C.C. World. AOL Time Warner is part of F.C.C. World. Jack Grubman, the former Salomon Smith Barney analyst who seems to have succeeded Kenneth Lay, of Enron, as the embodiment of the corporate scandals, is part of F.C.C. World. In the past two years, companies belonging to F.C.C. World have lost trillions of dollars in stock-market valuation, and have collectively served as a dead weight pulling down the entire stock market.This year, an alarmed and acerbic anonymous memorandum about the state of the F.C.C. has been circulating widely within F.C.C. World. It evokes F.C.C. World's feverish mood (The F.C.C. is fiddling while Rome burns) and suggests why nobody besides residents of F.C.C. World has thought of the commission in connection with the corporate scandals. The sentence I just quoted is followed by this explanation: The ILECs appear likely to enter all l.d. markets within twelve months, while losing virtually no residential customers to attackers since 1996, and suffering about 10% market share loss in business lines to CLECs. It's a lot easier to think about evil C.E.O.s than to decipher that.Even in good times, F.C.C. World pays obsessive attention to the commission's chairman. In bad times, the attention becomes especially intense, and when the chairman is a celebrity F.C.C. World devotes itself to full-time chairman-watching. The current chairman, Michael Powell, is a celebrity, at least by government-official standards, because he is the only son of Colin Powell, the Secretary of State. Unlike his father, he has a kind of mesmerizing ambiguity, which generates enormous, and at times apoplectically toned, speculation about who he really is and what he's really up to. Powell is young to be the head of a federal agency├óÔé¼ÔÇØhe is thirty-nine├óÔé¼ÔÇØand genially charming. Everybody likes him. Before becoming chairman, he was for three years one of the F.C.C.'s five commissioners, not only is he fluent in the F.C.C.'s incomprehensible patois, he has a Clintonesque love of the arcane details of communications policy. He's always saying that he's an avid moderate. And yet he has a rage-inciting quality. One of his predecessors as chairman, Reed Hundt, quoted in Forbes, compared Powell to Herbert Hoover. Mark Cooper, of the Consumer Federation of America, calls him radical and extreme. Just as often as he's accused of being a right-wing ideologue, Powell gets accused of being paralytically cautious. It ain't about singing 'Kum-Ba-Yah' around the campfire, another former chairman, William Kennard, says. You have to have an answer. One day last spring, Powell, testifying before a Senate subcommittee, delivered an anodyne opening statement, and the subcommittee's chairman, Ernest Hollings, of South Carolina, berated him. You don't care about these regulations, Hollings said. You don't care about the law or what Congress sets down. . . . That's the fundamental. That's the misgiving I have of your administration over there. It just is amazing to me. You just pell-mell down the road and seem to not care at all. I think you'd be a wonderful executive vice-president of a chamber of commerce, but not a chairman of a regulatory commission at the government level. Are you happy in your job?Extremely, Powell said, with an amiable smile.One cannot understand Powell's maddening effect, at least on Democrats and liberal activists, without understanding not just the stated purpose of the commission he chairs but also its real purpose. The F.C.C. was created by Congress in 1934, but it existed in prototype well before the New Deal, because it performs a function that is one of the classic easy cases for government intervention in the private economy: making sure that broadcasters stick to their assigned spots on the airwaves. Its other original function was preventing American Telephone & Telegraph, the national monopoly phone company, from treating its customers unfairly. Over the decades, as F.C.C. World grew up into a comfortable, well-established place, the F.C.C. segued into the role of industrial supervision├óÔé¼ÔÇØits real purpose. It was supposed to manage the competition among communications companies so that it didn't become too bloody, by artfully deciding who would be allowed to enter what line of business. In addition to looking out for the public's interest, the commission more specifically protected the interests of members of Congress, many of whom regard the media companies in their districts as the single most terrifying category of interest group├óÔé¼ÔÇØyou can cross the local bank president and live to tell the tale, but not the local broadcaster. According to an oft-told F.C.C. World anecdote, President Clinton once blocked an attempt to allow television stations to buy daily newspapers in the same city because, he said, if the so-and-so who owned the anti-Clinton Little Rock Democrat-Gazette had owned the leading TV station in Little Rock, too, Clinton would never have become President.F.C.C. World may have been con tentious, but it was settled, too, because all the reasonably powerful players had created secure economic niches for themselves. Then, in the nineteen-eighties, the successful breakup of A.T. & T.├óÔé¼ÔÇØby far the biggest and most important company the commission regulated├óÔé¼ÔÇØdeposited a thick additional sediment of self-confidence onto the consciousness of F.C.C. World. A generation ago, for most Americans, there was one local phone company, one long-distance company, and one company that manufactured telephones, which customers were not permitted to own├óÔé¼ÔÇØand they were all the same company. It was illegal to plug any device into a phone line. By the mid-nineteen-nineties, there were a dozen economically viable local phone companies, a handful of national long-distance companies competing to offer customers the lowest price and best service, and stores everywhere selling telephone equipment from many manufacturers├óÔé¼ÔÇØand millions of Americans had a fax machine and a modem operating over the telephone lines. A.T. & T. had argued for years that it was a natural monopoly, requiring protection from economic competition and total control over its lines. So much for that argument. Over the same period, the F.C.C. had assisted in the birth of cable television and cell phones and the Internet. It was the dream of federal-agency success come true: consumers vastly better served, and the industry much bigger and more prosperous, too.The next big step was supposed to be the Telecommunications Act of 1996, one of those massive, endlessly lobbied-over pieces of legislation which most people outside F.C.C. World probably felt it was safe to ignore. Although the Telecom Act sailed under the rhetorical banner of modernization and deregulation, its essence was a grand interest-group bargain, in which the local phone companies, known to headline writers as baby Bells and to F.C.C. World as arbocks (the pronounced version of RBOCs, or regional Bell operating companies), would be permitted to offer long-distance service in exchange for letting the long-distance companies and smaller new phone companies use their lines to compete for customers. Consumers would win, because for the first time they would get the benefits of competition in local service while getting even more competition than they already had in long distance. But the politics and economics of the Telecom Act (which was shepherded through Congress by Vice-President Gore) were just as important. Democrats saw the act as helping to reposition them as the technology party├óÔé¼ÔÇØthe party that brought the Internet into every home, created hundreds of thousands of jobs in new companies, and, not least, set off an investment boom whose beneficiaries might become the party's new contributor base. Clinton's slogans about the information superhighway and building a bridge to the twenty-first century, which, like all Clinton slogans, artfully sent different messages to different constituencies, were the rhetorical correlates of the Telecom Act, and Gore's cruise to the Presidency was supposed to be powered substantially by the act's success.The F.C.C. had a crucial role in all this. The arbocks are rich, aggressive, politically powerful, and generally Republican (though like all important interest groups they work with both parties), they immediately filed lawsuits, which wound up tying the hands of their new competitors in the local phone market for more than three years. Through rule-making, enforcement, and litigation, the F.C.C., then headed by Reed Hundt, who was Gore's classmate at St. Albans, was supposed to keep the arbocks in their cages, so that not only long-distance companies like A.T. & T. and MCI WorldCom but also a whole category of new companies, see-lecks (the pronounced version of CLECs, or competitive local exchange carriers), could emerge. This entailed the regulatory equivalent of hand-to-hand combat: the see-leck is supposed to have access to the arbock's switching equipment, the arbock won't give the seeleck a key to the room where it's kept, so the see-leck asks the F.C.C. to rule that the arbock has to give it the key.Partly because Hundt assured the see-lecks and other new companies that he would protect them, and partly because of the generally booming condition of the economy then, investment capital flooded into the see-lecks├óÔé¼ÔÇØcompanies with names like Winstar, Covad, and Teligent├óÔé¼ÔÇØand into other telecommunications companies. Even not obviously related technology companies like Cisco Systems benefitted from the telecom boom: demand for their products was supposed to come from the see-lecks and other new players. There would be no conflict between the interests of the new telecom companies and those of consumers, as one of Hundt's former lieutenants told me, Reed used to joke that my job was to make sure that all prices went down and all stocks went up.The years following the passage of the Telecom Act were the peak of the boom. Wall Street had its blood up, and that meant not just more startups but also more mergers of existing communications companies: Time Warner and AOL decided to throw in together, and A.T. & T. and Comcast, and so on. (Surely, WorldCom and the other telecom bad guys believed that their self-dealing, stock-overselling, and creative accounting would go unnoticed because the market was so undiscriminating.)By the time the outcome of the 2000 Presidential election had been determined, the telecom crash was well under way. Nonetheless, the chairmanship of the F.C.C. remained one of the best jobs, in terms of influence and visibility, available to a career government regulator. Three Republicans emerged as candidates: Powell, who was a commissioner, Harold Furchtgott-Roth, the farthest-to-the-right commissioner, and Patrick Wood, the head of the Texas Public Utility Commission and, as such, a George W. Bush guy. In Texas, however, Wood had crossed the most powerful person in the arbock camp, Edward Whitacre, the C.E.O. of S.B.C. Communications, which is headquartered in San Antonio. This meant that the arbocks didn't want Wood as head of the F.C.C., because he might be too pro-see-leck. (Wood is now the head of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.) Michael Powell had to signal the arbocks that he wasn't as threatening as Wood, while also signalling the conservative movement that he was only negligibly farther to the left than Furchtgott-Roth.Powell did this deftly. For example, in December of 2000 he appeared before a conservative group called the Progress & Freedom Foundation and gave a very Michael Powell speech├óÔé¼ÔÇØwhimsical, intellectual, and free-associative (Biblical history, Joseph Schumpeter, Moore's Law)├óÔé¼ÔÇØthat began by making fun of the idea that the F.C.C. should try to keep new telecom companies alive. In the wake of the 1996 Act, the F.C.C. is often cast as the Grinch who stole Christmas, Powell said. Like the Whos, down in Who-ville, who feast on Who-pudding and rare Who-roast beast, the communications industry was preparing to feast on the deregulatory fruits it believed would inevitably sprout from the Act's fertile soil. But this feast the F.C.C. Grinch did not like in the least, so it is thought. Thus Powell was indicating that if he became chairman he didn't expect to administer first aid to the see-lecks as part of the job. He was appointed to the chairmanship on the first day of the Bush Administration.Twenty months into the Administration, nearly all the see-lecks are dead or dying, nearly all long-distance companies, not just WorldCom, are in serious trouble, cable companies have lost half their value, satellite companies are staggering. The crash has had an automatically concentrating effect, because as new companies die the existing companies' market share increases, and, if the existing companies are in good shape financially, they have the opportunity to pick up damaged companies at bargain prices. During the Bush Administration, as the financial carnage in communications has worsened, the communications industry has moved in the direction of more concentration. If the Bells wind up protecting their regional monopolies in local phone service, and if they also merge, the country will be on its way to having a national duopoly in local service: Verizon, in the East, and S.B.C., in the West. And these companies could dominate long distance as well, because of the poor health of the long-distance companies.The cable business also seems close to having two dominant national companies, AOL Time Warner and Comcast. Unlike the phone companies, they don't have to share their wiring with other companies and so can more fully control what material they allow to enter people's homes. As part of the complicated bargaining with interest groups that led to the 1996 Telecom Act, the limits on concentration in the radio industry were significantly loosened, and in the past six years the number of radio-station owners in the United States has been cut by twenty-five per cent, today, a large portion of local and national radio news programming is supplied by a single company, Westwood One, a subsidiary of Viacom.In this situation, many Democrats and liberals think, the F.C.C. should be hyperactive├óÔé¼ÔÇØthe superhero of government regulation, springing to the rescue of both consumers and the communications industry. It should try to breathe life into the see-lecks and other new companies. It should disallow mergers, maintain ownership limits, and otherwise restrain the forces of concentration. It should use the government's money and muscle to get new technology├óÔé¼ÔÇØespecially fast Internet connections├óÔé¼ÔÇØinto the homes of people who can't afford it at current market prices. (An analogy that a lot of people in F.C.C. World make is between telecom and the Middle East: the Clinton people blame the bloodshed on the Bush people, because they disengaged when they came into office, and the Bush people blame it on the Clinton people, because they raised too many expectations and stirred too many passions.)But Michael Powell's F.C.C. has not been hyperactive. Powell has been conducting internal policy reviews and reforming the management of the F.C.C. and waiting for the federal courts and the Congress to send him signals. (In mid-September, Powell finally initiated a formal review of the F.C.C.'s limits on media concentration.) This doesn't mean he has been inactive, rather, he has been active in a way that further infuriates his critics├óÔé¼ÔÇØin a manner that smoothly blends the genial and the provocative, he muses about whether the fundamental premises of F.C.C. World really make sense, while giving the impression that he's having the time of his life as chairman. At his first press conference, when he was asked what he was going to do about the digital divide├óÔé¼ÔÇØthat is, economic inequality in access to the Internet├óÔé¼ÔÇØhe said, You know, I think there is a Mercedes divide. I'd like to have one and I can't afford one. At the National Cable & Telecommunications Association convention, in Chicago, Powell, following a troupe of tumblers to the stage, interrupted his walk to the podium to perform a somersault.Not long ago, I went to see Powell in his office at the F.C.C. Until 1998, when the commission moved to a new building in Southwest Washington, near the city's open-air fish market, F.C.C. World was at the western edge of downtown, where everybody would encounter everybody else at a few familiar restaurants and bars. Today, the F.C.C. building looks like the office of a mortgage company in a suburban office park. Even the chairman's suite, though large, is beige, carpeted, and fluorescent. Powell is a bulky man who wears gold-rimmed glasses and walks with a pronounced limp, the result of injuries he suffered in a jeep accident in Germany, in 1987, when he was an Army officer. Because of the accident, he left the Army and went to law school, where he became entranced with conservative ideas about regulation, particularly the idea that the government, rather than trying to correct the flaws of the market before the fact├óÔé¼ÔÇØprophylactically, as he likes to say├óÔé¼ÔÇØshould wait till the flaws manifest themselves and then use antitrust litigation to fix them. He worked briefly at a corporate law firm, and then became a prot├â┬®g├â┬® of Joel Klein, the head of the antitrust division of the Clinton Justice Department and the man who led the government's legal case against Microsoft. (He was recently appointed chancellor of the New York public-school system.) It testifies to Powell's political skill that he is probably the only high official in the Bush Administration who not only served in the Clinton Administration but also maintains close ties to Bush's nemesis Senator John McCain, of Arizona. One of the things about Powell that annoy people is his enduring love of law school├óÔé¼ÔÇØIt's sort of like a law-school study session over there, one Democratic former commissioner said. As if to confirm the charge, Powell, when I arrived, introduced me to four law students, summer interns at the commission, whom he'd invited to sit in.I began by asking Powell whether he agreed with the founding assumptions of the F.C.C. For example, could private companies have apportioned the airwaves among themselves without the government being involved?I think we'll never know, Powell said. I don't think it's an automatically bad idea, the way some people will argue. Land is probably the best analogue. We don't seize all the land in the United States and say, 'The government will issue licenses to use land.' If my neighbor puts a fence one foot onto my property line, there's a whole body of law about what I can do about that, including whether I can tear it down. If a wireless company was interfering with another wireless company, it's a similar proposition. There are scholars who argue├óÔé¼ÔÇØindeed, the famous Ronald Coase treatise that won the Nobel Prize was about this├óÔé¼ÔÇØthat spectrum policy is lunacy. The market could work this out, in the kinds of ways that we're accustomed to.Talking to Powell was fun. Unlike most high government officials, he doesn't seem to be invested in appearing dignified or commanding. He slumps in his chair and fiddles with his tie and riffs. He speaks in ironic air quotes. He's like your libertarian friend in college who enjoyed staying up all night asking impertinent rhetorical questions about aspects of life that everybody else takes for granted but that he sees as sentimental or illogical. After a while, I asked him whether he thought his predecessors' excitement about the 1996 Telecommunications Act had been excessive.I would start with a caveat, Powell said. Look, I can't fault those judgments in and of themselves, given the time and what people thought. They were not the only ones who were hysterical about the opportunities. But, frankly, I've always been a little bit critical. First of all, anybody who works with the act knows that it doesn't come anywhere close to matching the hyperbole that was associated with it, by the President on down, about the kinds of things it's going to open up. I mean, I don't know what provisions are the information-superhighway provisions, or what provisions are so digitally oriented, or some of the things that were a big part of the theatre of its introduction. When one starts reading the details, one searches, often in vain, for these provisions. But, nonetheless, there was a rising dot-com excitement, and an Internet excitement, and people thought this was historic legislation, and it certainly was.But. We were sucking helium out of balloons, with the kinds of expectations that were being bandied around, and this is before the economy or the market even gets in trouble. It was a dramatically exaggerated expectation├óÔé¼ÔÇØby the leadership of the commission, by politicians, by the market itself, by companies themselves. It was a gold rush, and led to some very detrimental business decisions, ones that government encouraged by its policies, frankly. Everybody wanted to see numbers go up on the board.Powell began imitating an imagined true believer in the Telecom Act.  'I want to see ten competitors. Twenty competitors! I want to see thirty-per-cent market share. Fifty-per-cent market share! I want the Bells to bleed! Then we'll know we've succeeded.'  Now Powell returned to being Powell. I think that expectation was astonishingly unrealistic, in the short term. They wanted to see it while they're there. We were starting to get drunk on the juice we were drinking. And the market was getting drunk on the juice we were drinking. There's no question, we went too soon too fast. Too many companies took on too much debt too fast before the market really had a product, or a business model.How could the Telecom Act have been handled better? We could have chosen policies that were less hellbent on a single objective, and were slightly more balanced and put more economic discipline in the system, Powell said. Money chased what seemed like government-promised opportunity. The problem with that is there's a morning after, and we're in it. And the problem is there is no short fix for this problem. This debt is going to take years to bring down to a realistic level. In some ways, for short-term gain, we paid a price in long-term stability.Powell went on to say that it might have turned out differently if there had been a more reasonable level of investment. No, we wouldn't have every home in America with competitive choice yet├óÔé¼ÔÇØbut we don't anyway. I don't think it's the remonopolization of telephone service. I don't buy that. The Bells will prosper, but did anybody believe they wouldn't? The part of the story that didn't materialize was that people thought so would MCI WorldCom and Sprint.Other local phone companies, he added, hadn't materialized as viable businesses, either, and they never might. Everybody's always saying, 'The regulators did this and this and this.' But, candidly, the story's quite the opposite. I think the regulators bent over backward for six years to give them a chance. Conditions don't get that good except once every thirty years, and it didn't happen. So, whatever the reason, we're looking at a WorldCom that's teetering. We're looking at a long-distance business that has had a rapid decline in its revenue base. A.T. & T. is breaking itself up. Sprint has struggled.Could the F.C.C. have done anything to make the long-distance companies stronger? At the F.C.C.? I think I'll just be blunt. My political answer? Yes, there's all kinds of things we can do at the margin to try to help. But I can't find thirty billion dollars for WorldCom somewhere. I can't mitigate the impacts of an accounting scandal and an S.E.C. investigation. Were I king, it would be wonderful, but I don't have those kinds of levers. I don't know whether anybody does. At some point, companies are expected to run themselves in a way that keeps them from dying. Powell couldn't have made it much clearer that he doesn't think it's his responsibility to do anything about the telecom crash. He has demonstrated his sure political touch by making accommodationist gestures├óÔé¼ÔÇØin August, for example, five months after disbanding the F.C.C.'s Accounting Safeguards Division, Powell announced that he was appointing a committee to study accounting standards in the communications industry. But that shows that Powell is better at riding out the storm than, say, Harvey Pitt, his counterpart at the Securities and Exchange Commission, and does not mean that he plans to try to shore up the telecom industry.I asked Powell if it would bother him if, for most people, only one company provided cable television and only one provided local phone service. Yes, he said. It concerns us that there's one of each of those things, but let's not diminish the importance of there being one of each of those things. That still is a nice suite of communications capabilities, even if they aren't direct analogues of each other. Anyway, Powell said, before long the phone companies will be able to provide video service over their lines, and the cable companies will provide data service over their lines, so there will be more choice. So, yeah, we have this anxiety: we have one of everything. The question is, Does it stay that way?The concentration of ownership and the concentrated control of information did not appear to trouble Powell, either. He said that people confuse bigness, which brings many benefits, with concentration, which distorts markets. If this were just economics, it's easy. If you were to say to me, 'Mike, just worry about economic concentration,' we know how to do that├óÔé¼ÔÇØthe econometrics of antitrust. I can tell you when a market's too concentrated and prices are going to rise. The problem is other dimensions, like political, ideological, sometimes emotional. Take the question of, if everybody's controlling what you see, the assumption there is that somehow there'll be this viewpoint, a monolithic viewpoint, pushed on you by your media and you won't get diversity. I think that's a possibility. I don't think it's nearly the possibility that's ascribed to it sometimes.Powell explained, Sometimes when we see very pointed political or parochial programming, it gets attacked as unfair. I see some of the same people who claim they want diversity go crazy when Rush Limbaugh exists. They love diversity, but somehow we should run Howard Stern off the planet. If it has a point of view, then it becomes accused of bias, and then we have policies like├óÔé¼ÔÇØhere his tone went from ironic to sarcastic├óÔé¼ÔÇØthe fairness doctrine, which see"

owned subsidiary formerly run by enron ' s chief financial officer .  this arrangement , which was not discussed in past sec filings , has led to a growing distrust of the company by the financial community .  in our opinion , the market is most likely overreacting to the news being disseminated over the last few days .  however , we can give no assurances that all the problems at enron have been fully disclosed ,  heim said . in its statement this morning , enron said although its internal and external auditors and attorneys have reviewed the related -

' ' shipman said . ` ` investors are worried they might have to share their enron earnings with a lot more people than they originally thought . ' ' worrisome financing enron ' s auditors and attorneys reviewed the company ' s ` ` related party arrangements , ' ' the board approved them , and they were disclosed in sec filings , enron said in its statement . that hasn ' t eased concerns . the reduction of shareholder equity by $ 1 . 2 billion from the ljm partnerships is reason to worry about enron ' s other financing vehicles , wrote niles , the salomon analyst . enron also may take another $ 2 . 4 billion in losses from investments in the dabhol power plant in india and projects in south america , he wrote . enron ' s 8 percent coupon bonds due in 2005 fell $ 34 per $ 1 , 000 face value to be offered at $ 1 , 022 today from $ 1 , 056 on friday , traders said . yield on the debt rose to 7 . 33 percent from 6 . 33 percent . based on bloomberg composite ratings , most of enron ' s long - term debt is rated at bbb 2 and bbbl , two or three levels above investment grade . fastow continues to work , and enron hasn ' t punished him , palmer said . fastow declined to be interviewed , spokeswoman karen denne said . sec spokesman john heine declined to comment on the agency ' s request to enron . ` ` we believe everything that needed to be considered and done in connection with these transactions was considered and done , ' ' lay said in the statement . uniprime signs letter of intent for wind energy park project 10 / 22 / 2001 business wire ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , business wire ) apache junction , ariz . - - ( business wire ) - - oct . 22 , 2001 - - uniprime capital corporation inc .

2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . dj cnbc ' s faber report : enron / dynegy deal talk 2001 - 11 - 07 14 : 56 ( new york ) the following is a transcript of a report aired wednesday by cnbc reporter david faber : enron is in discussions with dynegy about a range of options that include a merger of the two companies . while such an outcome is only one of a number of options being discussed , sources close to the talks tell me such an outcome is being considered . enron is trying to raise equity capital and restore confidence amid the complete collapse of its stock price . today , the houston - based energy trading concern ' s shares have fallen another 25 % , while its bonds , perhaps a better barometer of the market ' s concerns about credit quality , have shed roughly ten points . enron will not comment . but sources close to the situation tell me the company continues to speak with a handful of private equity firms about an investment . those talks are still in the early stages . talks with dynegy , a cross - town rival of enron ' s that also markets and trades energy , have progressed at a faster pace . dynegy is unlike enron in that it owns more hard assets , many of which came along with the acquisition of illnova , completed in 2000 . while many potential acquirers have shied away from enron due to continued concern about unknown liabilities the company may have , dynegy is very familiar with its energy trading business . dynegy is the number two player in the u . s . energy trading market and would clearly become the dominant player were it to merge with or acquire enron . a dynegy spokesman declined comment . while dynegy has off - balance sheet financings that are similar to enron ' s , those financings are not guaranteed by the parent . it is such guarantees that have concerned enron investors along with a series of questionable investments . given the massive decline in enron ' s stock price , dynegy now has a market value that is twice that of enron . that decline in enron ' s stock price would make any equity infusion heavily dilutive , if private equity firms were to choose to invest in enron they would likely do so in the form of a security that converted to equity and paid a dividend . still , because enron now has a market value of only $ 5 . 3 billion , the roughly $ 2 billion it may want represents an enormous percentage of its overall equity value . hence , discussion with dynegy may have taken on the form of a merger , rather than a strategic investment . enron in talks with dynegy that may include merger , cnbc says 2001 - 11 - 07 13 : 39 ( new york ) houston , nov . 7 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . is talking with rival energy company dynegy inc . about a number of options , including merger , to help it raise equity capital and restore confidence , financial news network cnbc reported . spokesmen for dynegy and enron declined to comment . wsj : dynegy in talks to put about $ 2 b into enron now by robin sidel 11 / 07 / 2001 dow jones news service ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones the wall street journal , 212 - 274 - 7991 copyright ?

- enron corp . says it owes citigroup inc . , j . p . morgan chase & co . and bank of new york co . $ 7 . 55 billion in the largest bankruptcy case in u . s . history . analysts say the amount owed the banks may be less than half that . here ' s where they differ . enron yesterday said in court papers it owed thousands of creditors $ 31 . 2 billion in loans , unpaid bills and other debts . citigroup , the biggest creditor , is owed $ 3 billion stemming from a loan it arranged last year , enron said . still , the banks probably hold only a fraction of the debts enron says they ' re owed . that ' s because banks routinely sell parts of loans to other lenders as a way to disperse risk . banks also are listed as the holders of bonds and other securities that in fact are owned by investors . the banks are listed as the creditors in enron ' s papers . ` ` it ' s very difficult to piece together the reality , ' ' said robert napoli , an analyst at abn amro inc . who owns citigroup shares . ` ` they ' ve syndicated out a portion of the loan and they could have hedged the credit risk through derivatives . ' ' citigroup , the largest u . s . financial services company , is probably owed $ 1 billion at most , analysts say , and much of that is backed by collateral such as gas pipelines , on which it should be able to collect . the company ' s profit may be lowered by between $ 250 million and $ 500 million before taxes , or between 3 cents and 5 cents a share after taxes , as a result of its involvement with enron , said napoli , who recommends investors buy citigroup shares . citigroup earned $ 2 . 08 a share in the first nine months of the year . hurting earnings j . p . morgan chase - - which enron says is owed $ 2 . 1 billion - - says its exposure totals about $ 900 million - - $ 500 million unsecured , and $ 400 million backed by collateral . that exposure could result in a 15 - cent decline in earnings per share , said goldman , sachs & co . analyst richard strauss . the second - largest u . s . bank earned $ 1 . 54 a share so far this year . j . p . morgan chase acts as a representative for holders of enron bonds , so while the company is listed by enron as a creditor on $ 1 . 9 billion of bonds , it may not be owed a cent on that debt . enron ' s $ 2 . 45 billion debt to bank of new york may work in much the same way , said lehman brothers analyst henry dickson . he estimated the bank is owed about $ 50 million . much of j . p . morgan ' s exposure is tied to citigroup ' s $ 3 billion loan to enron , a credit enron doesn ' t even mention . a syndicate of at least five other banks - - including j . p . morgan chase - - contributed to that loan , according to bloomberg data . as lead arranger , citigroup likely holds about 10 percent of the loan , meaning its exposure is about $ 300 million . j . p . morgan chase ' s share of that is likely less . bank of america corp . , commerzbank ag and barclays bank plc are among other enron lenders not listed as creditors . still , concern that the banks ' losses may exceed forecasts helped send their shares and bonds lower today . citigroup shares fell 99 cents to $ 46 . 91 in trading on the new york stock exchange . citigroup ' s 7 . 25 percent notes due in 2010 fell to 107 28 / 32 from 108 21 / 32 , pushing the yield up 21 basis points to 6 . 18 percent from 5 . 97 percent . j . p . morgan ' s stock lost $ 1 . 17 to $ 36 . 55 . its 7 . 9 percent coupon notes due in 2010 fell $ 16 per $ 1 , 000 face amount to 111 3 / 32 , pushing the yield up 23 basis points to 6 . 18 percent from 5 . 95 percent on friday . bank of new york ' s 7 . 3 percent notes maturing in 2009 fell about $ 20 per $ 1 , 000 face value to 108 3 / 32 from 110 7 / 32 , traders said . yield on the debt rose 32 basis points to 6 . 01 percent from 5 . 69 percent . its shares dropped $ 1 . 04 to $ 38 . 20 . ` ` they ' re big numbers , but these are big institutions , ' ' said greg habeeb , a bond money manager at calvert group , which doesn ' t own the banks ' securities . ` ` i wouldn ' t be going running out buying the bonds now , but i don ' t think ( enron losses are ) big enough to worry about .

afternoon trading by peter edmonston 12 / 03 / 2001 dow jones business news ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) the wall street journal online stocks retreated monday as conflict in the middle east and a bankruptcy filing by energy giant enron outweighed better - than - expected economic data . in late - afternoon trading , the dow jones industrial average was down 101 points , or 1 % , to 9751 after trading nearly 150 points lower earlier in the day . the dow industrials fell 22 . 14 points friday . meanwhile , the nasdaq composite index lost 22 points , or 1 . 1 % , to 1908 . 60 after closing 2 . 68 points lower in the previous session . other major indexes also declined monday . the standard & poor ' s 500 - stock index dropped 9 . 60 to 1129 . 90 , the russell 2000 index fell 2 . 80 to 458 , and the new york stock exchange composite index shed four to 575 . 20 . bonds turned higher in choppy trading . the dollar strengthened against the yen and the euro . concerns over the fallout from the weekend ' s suicide bombings in israel damped any beneficial effects from economic reports that exceeded wall street ' s expectations .  the events in israel have created a lot of uncertainty ,  said peter coolidge , senior equity trader at brean murray & co .  that more than counteracts any positive news on the economic front .  at least 25 people were killed over the weekend in attacks by palestinian suicide bombers in jerusalem and the northern israeli port city of haifa . on monday , israel fired nine missiles near palestinian leader yasser arafat ' s headquarters in gaza city in an apparent retaliation . the violence overseas detracted from some fairly upbeat readings on the u . s . economy , including a report from the commerce department that consumer spending rose by a record 2 . 9 % in october . robust spending on cars and other big - ticket items contributed to the reading ' s largest jump since 1959 , when the data series began . the previous record had been a 2 . 6 % increase in september 1987 . personal income was virtually unchanged for the second month in a row , roughly in line with economists ' forecasts . the commerce department also surprised economists by reporting a 1 . 9 % increase in total construction spending for october . forecasts had that figure falling by 0 . 5 % . september construction spending was revised to show a 0 . 7 % drop from the 0 . 4 % decline previously reported . meanwhile , a closely watched index of manufacturing activity rose more than expected in november . the national association of purchasing management reported monday that its purchasing managers index rose to 44 . 5 last month from 39 . 8 in october . economists have been forecasting the pmi would rise to 42 . a pmi reading of 42 . 7 is considered the threshold between expansion and contraction in the wider economy . so november ' s pmi of 44 . 5 suggests that the economy is growing , albeit slowly . last week , the national bureau of economic research formally declared that the country had entered a recession back in march , ending the longest period of economic expansion in u . s . history . the government reported that total economic activity fell at an annual rate of 1 . 1 % in the july - september quarter . against this backdrop , analysts called the latest napm data encouraging .  after absorbing last month ' s aftershock of the terrorist attacks , the manufacturing sector showed surprising resilience in november ,  norbert ore , director of the survey , said in a statement .  the trend is definitely in the right direction , but it is too soon to claim an imminent recovery . based on this report , the sector regained a significant portion of the output lost in october ,  mr . ore said . matthew freedman , an economist at economy . com , said the napm report  shows that the deterioration in manufacturing appears to be slowing quite dramatically .  but the stronger - than - expected numbers did little to comfort investors , who have been scrutinizing economic readings in recent weeks for signs that the business cycle has hit bottom . the markets are especially interested to see if rising levels of unemployment will put a dent in consumer spending , which is considered a key to keeping the current economic recession a mild one . most major international markets traded lower monday , but the u . s . economic data helped narrow the losses late in the day in europe . frankfurt ' s xetra dax closed essentially flat and london ' s financial times stock exchange 100 - share finished 0 . 8 % lower . in asia , tokyo ' s nikkei 225 stock average closed with a loss of 3 . 1 % , and hong kong ' s hang seng index dropped 1 . 1 % . meanwhile , the turmoil surrounding energy - trading giant enron continued over the weekend , as the company filed for bankruptcy protection on sunday . the houston firm simultaneously sued its would - be merger partner dynegy for  not less than $ 10 billion ,  accusing it of wrongful termination of their merger pact . news of the impending collapse of enron had weighed heavily on the market last week . some market participants suggested enron ' s bankruptcy filing - - the largest in u . s . history - - continued to pull stocks lower on monday . but others said it was largely expected and was having little effect on share prices .  it could hurt the markets somewhere down the road , but i haven ' t heard a lot of people talking about it [ monday ] ,  said mr . coolidge of brean murray . enron shares rose 11 cents to 37 cents . dynegy was down nearly 8 % . financial - services stocks took a hit monday , dragged lower by some negative comments from analysts and fears about exposure to the enron debacle . shares of brokerage firm morgan stanley sank 6 % after goldman sachs analyst richard strauss pulled it from his recommended list and cut his rating on the stock to  market perform  from  market outperform .  mr . strauss said that the 60 % surge in morgan stanley ' s shares since sept . 20 has made it expensive compared to its peers . citigroup , a component of the dow jones industrials , declined nearly 2 . 7 % and j . p . morgan fell 3 . 8 % . the two companies advised on the failed merger between enron and dynegy and now find themselves among enron ' s largest unsecured creditors . automotive stocks were also trading lower monday as the big auto makers offered up monthly sales results for november . shares of ford motor were down 6 . 1 % on news that it is expected to warn this week that quarterly results will miss forecasts . separately , the company reported a 4 . 4 % increase in total u . s . vehicle sales , helped by 0 % financing offers . ford rival general motors , which has also been offering generous financing plans to lure buyers , reported a 13 . 3 % jump in car and truck sales from a year ago . shares of gm fell 1 . 4 % . in major u . s . market action : stocks fell . on the big board , where 923 . 7 million shares traded , 1 , 804 stocks fell and 1 , 291 rose . on the nasdaq , 1 . 17 billion shares changed hands . bonds rose . the 10 - year treasury note rose more than 1 / 4 point , or $ 2 . 50 for each $ 1 , 000 invested . the yield , which moves inversely to price , fell to 4 . 71 % . the 30 - year bond added more than 3 / 8 point to yield 5 . 26 % . the dollar strengthened . it bought 123 . 93 yen and traded at 89 . 14 cents to the euro , compared with 123 . 44 yen and 89 . 65 cents late friday in new york . copyright ( c ) 2001 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . dueling enron , dynegy lawsuits start of long battle by janet whitman of dow jones newswires 12 / 03 / 2001 dow jones news service ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) new york -

2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . finance source : world reporter ( tm ) - ft mccarthy the company ' s trials have just begun lawyers are swarming all over enron ' s old financial statements and press releases in the hope of reaping huge fees from securities litigation . more than 20 class - action lawsuits have been filed in recent weeks , and new ones are popping up every day . a formal process has been started to consolidate litigation in houston , where the troubled energy company is based , with all lawyers interested in the case required to stake their claims by december 21 st . the broadest accusations will be of fraud and material misstatement , legal ways of saying that the company ' s financial statements were garbage . this week , enron ' s founder and chairman , kenneth lay , decided to forgo a severance package worth over $ 60 m while admitting that the company ' s problems  had been exacerbated by the extensive use of debt capital , both on and off the balance sheet  . america ' s financial accounting standards board ( fasb ) is looking again at off - balance - sheet financing , having fretted about it on and off for a decade . there will also be charges of insider trading , because even as enron was issuing securities amid glowing profits reports , top executives were dumping over $ 1 billion of enron shares to  unsuspecting investors  , a group that includes anybody who , however briefly , has held one of the company ' s 750 m shares in the past two years .  the number of class members will be huge ,  says maurice pesso , a lawyer at a new york firm that has filed a claim . there are , however , limits to the company ' s liability . it has already restated its results going back five years , but federal law restricts litigation to the past three . moreover , enron will not take the rap alone . its auditor , arthur andersen ( now plain andersen ) , is also named as a defendant in at least one of the complaints already filed . the litigation comes after a rough decade for andersen . it has had to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in settlements after sloppy audits on such companies as waste management , sunbeam and discovery zone . because enron evolved from an energy company into a financial firm , it became much like an unregulated bank . the lack of supervision meant that the role of the company ' s auditor was crucial . andersen was certainly paid as if it was . in 2000 , it collected $ 25 m for auditing enron ' s books and another $ 27 m for consulting services . now how do you account for that ?

' ' enron became overleveraged , ' ' kenneth l . lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive , said this week , adding that things went wrong in ways that ' ' i could not have ever contemplated . ' ' he pointed to investments that ' ' performed far worse than we ever could have imagined . ' ' that was the first time that enron had admitted it had a leverage problem , and it came only after the brutal reality had become apparent to many others . mr . lay says he understood what was going on , but i suspect he had left crucial details to others who have since departed and did not fully grasp the reality that was obscured by enron ' s soothing financial statements . when enron was riding high , it could easily have sold stock to raise capital that it now desperately wants . mr . lay and other executives sold stock , but the company did not . just a month ago , mr . lay spoke enthusiastically of how great the company ' s continuing earnings were . the leverage was not easy to find . a lot of it was carried off enron ' s balance sheet . partnerships and special - purpose entities that enron set up borrowed money and funneled the cash to enron . enron guaranteed the debt but did not have to show it on its own balance sheet because it could meet its obligations by issuing stock . as undisclosed losses built up in those entities , it became more likely they could not pay their bills , leaving enron to do so . it is also clear that the bond rating agencies did not understand enron ' s plight until the last couple of weeks . when they figured it out , it took a $ 1 . 5 billion equity infusion that is part of the dynegy takeover to keep enron ' s rating above junk level . now enron has a board committee investigating various transactions , and promises to release details as they are uncovered . officials speak as if they are learning what happened for the first time , and perhaps they are . jeffrey skilling , mr . lay ' s protege , was enron ' s chief financial engineer until he quit this summer . and enron ' s chief financial officer and treasurer were ousted as enron unraveled . some investors would say none of that matters now , that the only important fact is that dynegy is buying enron anyway . chuck watson , dynegy ' s chief executive , is convinced that enron ' s energy trading business is a gem that more than justifies the price dynegy is paying . he figures the losses from the bad investments can be contained . the big question now may be whether mr . watson will retain his enthusiasm after his people study enron ' s trading positions . enron has always said it hedged its big derivative positions - - positions that can contain huge leverage that does not show up on the balance sheet - - but some of that hedging was with affiliated companies . if big surprises are found , dynegy could back out of the deal . there is plenty of blame to go around here , and suits have been filed against enron , its current and former officials , and its auditor , arthur andersen . but investors also bear responsibility . enron ' s financial statements were , as mr . lay conceded this week , ' ' opaque and difficult to understand . ' ' investors and analysts knew they did not know what was going on . they bought anyway . enron was viewed as a company that always made its numbers . an old - line gas pipeline company had been transformed into a brilliant trader that could apply its magic around the world . investors did not care how enron made the numbers . now , when it is too late , they do . graph tracks the monthly closes of enron ' s stock price from 1998 through 2001 . yesterday ' s close : $ 9 . 48 copyright ? 2000 dow jones section a a quick change in fortune dulls the glimmer of houston by jim yardley 11 / 16 / 2001 the new york times page 14 , column 1 c . 2001 new york times company houston , nov . 15 - - on a day when oil prices plunged to two - year lows , when the hometown enron corporation continued its ugly free fall and when gloomy projections showed the local economy headed for a decidedly rough patch , george alcorn lunched on chilean sea bass at the downtown petroleum club and decided that the sky was not falling .

' ' that mr . alcorn could sound upbeat in such seemingly grim economic times is hardly surprising in a city largely built on pluck and buoyant optimism . until recently , economists had predicted that the economic downturn plaguing the rest of the nation would largely bypass houston , the nation ' s energy capital . in june , the economist magazine , citing houston ' s increasingly diverse economy , even promoted it as a candidate for the world ' s next great international city and business center . but june is a long time ago . by then , the city had already lost 2 , 000 jobs from the struggling computer maker compaq and will probably now lose thousands more if the company ' s merger with hewlett - packard is approved . in the aftermath of the sept . 11 terrorist attacks , continental airlines , which is based here , announced 12 , 000 layoffs , some likely to come in houston . the texas medical center , one of the largest medical complexes in the world , is facing financial peril after flooding in june caused an estimated $ 2 billion in damages . the latest blow to the economy as well as the local psyche is the plight of enron , the energy company that some analysts said tottered near bankruptcy before a merger with its local rival , dynegy , was announced last week . even if the merger goes through , the city is expected to feel a crunch ; local real estate analysts say the merger could produce a glut of downtown office space at a time when new towers are under construction , including one by enron . one visible symbol of the changing fortunes is that two of the city ' s sports stadiums , enron field and compaq center , are named for companies that soon may not exist . this week , the national association of purchasing management , which measures business activity and industrial production , released a report showing that houston ' s economy had contracted in october after 32 consecutive months of expansion . ' ' over the first half of this year , you had to feel pretty good , ' ' said bill gilmer , an economist at the federal reserve bank of dallas and an authority on houston . but mr . gilmer said that much of the city ' s recent job growth was driven by oil and gas companies and that the decline in prices meant the sector was ' ' running out of steam . ' ' ' ' the national economy , ' ' mr . gilmer added , ' ' is not helping out right now . ' ' the fact that the ailing national economy is dragging on houston is , oddly enough , evidence of the city ' s success in recovering from the 1980 ' s oil bust . then , with the local economy dominated by oil and gas , the drop in prices crushed the city and prompted civic leaders to preach economic diversification . and it worked : compaq , continental , the texas medical center as well as dramatic growth in small business helped houston recover and grow even faster , becoming the nation ' s fourth - largest city . the new generation of sophisticated energy companies , led by enron , then created a boom . economists say the next several months are likely to be slow . there could be substantial layoffs if compaq and enron mergers take place . mr . gilmer said the price of oil still played a large role in the city ' s economy ; the number of exploration rigs has dropped to roughly 1 , 000 from about 1 , 300 in recent months . yet no one is predicting a reprise of the bust , when downtown office buildings stood practically empty . instead , economists point to a relatively quick rebound . ray perryman , a texas economist who runs the perryman group , said houston still had an infrastructure envied by most other cities , including the city ' s bustling port , the nation ' s second largest . the city was recently named as one of four finalists to become the american entry to be host of the 2012 olympic games . voters recently approved construction of a starter light rail line , and federal environmental officials recently signed off on a plan to greatly reduce air pollution . ' ' we ' re sitting here with over two million jobs , ' ' said former mayor bob lanier . the downfall of enron , though , a company whose value dropped almost 90 percent because of accounting problems and financial distress , has been the most highly publicized and unexpected blow to the city ' s economy . the company had embodied the self - image that houston business leaders hold dear : it was entrepreneurial , aggressive and ground breaking . it was also a generous civic benefactor ; the company ' s chairman , kenneth l . lay , a close friend of president bush , had even been rumored as a potential mayoral candidate . but this week , enron ' s lost glory became painfully evident . in a hall at rice university on tuesday , mr . lay presented alan greenspan , the federal reserve chairman , with a lifetime achievement award , the enron prize , which mr . lay ' s company had endowed and named in flush times . the next morning , an article in the houston chronicle said no decision had been made on whether the name of the prize would be changed . photos : compaq center , home of the n . b . a . houston rockets , is named for a company that soon may not exist . enron , above , may soon be acquired by a rival energy company .

( operating cash flow at cablevision is defined as operating profit before depreciation and amortization . ) insurance will cover some of the cost of the johnson - longley payouts . ' ' the team looks healthy , ' ' jim dolan , the president of cablevision , said on tuesday during a conference call with analysts . ' ' i don ' t expect any more write - offs . ' ' whether that turns out to be true depends on whether any currently hearty player sustains a career - ending injury . but cablevision could have avoided this financial circumstance had it paid attention to the physical conditions of johnson and longley . in each case , the garden knew it was acquiring damaged goods . in his second season in charlotte , johnson hurt his back , and he has never been the same . maybe the garden was swayed that he was well enough , because he averaged 20 . 5 points and 8 . 4 rebounds in the season before it traded anthony mason for him . but the persistence of his back problems in the last few seasons attests to the riskiness of getting him in the first place . the back compromised his skills , often limiting him to being a symbol of the knicks ' grit . he also spelled ' ' l ' ' with his bended arm quite nicely , yet not worth an average of $ 7 million a year . when longley arrived from phoenix last year in the four - team deal that sent patrick ewing to seattle , he said he had told the knicks that he had a degenerative ankle condition . ' ' i brought up my ankle in my physical with the knicks , ' ' he said in july , ' ' and they said , ' have you been playing ? ' i said , ' yes , ' and that was it . ' ' the fact was , he played for the australian olympic team in sydney last year , but pain from his ankle kept him from practicing . should have been a tip - off . the naming rights dance enron field , home of the houston home run , is bound to be called something different next season when jimy williams starts his tenure as the astros ' manager . enron , the world ' s largest energy trader , agreed to pay $ 100 million to put its name on the ballpark for 30 years , a deal that began last year . but enron is in trouble . it has lost nearly $ 60 billion in its market value ; the company recently said it had overstated its profits for the past five years by nearly $ 600 million and it agreed to be acquired by dynergy for $ 9 billion . in another part of houston , the compaq center could take on another name now that the computer maker it was named for in 1997 ( at $ 900 , 000 annually for six years ) is planning to merge with hewlett - packard . in 2003 , the rockets will move to a new arena . named stadiums and arenas have changed monikers before . a takeover turned philadelphia ' s comcast center into the first union center . the twa dome in st . louis is now the dome at america ' s center to reflect twa ' s purchase by american airlines . marine midland arena in buffalo now has hsbc ' s name . meanwhile , pro player stadium near miami is named for a defunct division of the bankrupt fruit of the loom . two other n . f . l . stadiums , one being built , the other three years old , are named for ailing companies . in foxboro , mass . , cmgi field is being readied for play next season by the new england patriots . in the 12 months ended july 31 , cmgi , an internet development company , lost $ 4 . 4 billion ( twice the annual network tv payments to the n . f . l . ) . cmgi will pay $ 114 million over 15 years for its naming deal - - if it lasts that long . psinet , an internet communications services provider that is paying $ 105 . 5 million over 20 years to be the name atop the baltimore ravens ' stadium , filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection earlier this year after losing $ 3 . 2 billion in the quarter ending march 31 . the conseco fieldhouse in indiana , the home of the pacers , is named for a finance and insurance company that recently posted a $ 410 million quarterly loss . the financial state of some airlines since sept . 11 may affect some of the arenas and stadiums named for them . besides the dome in st . louis , six other facilities are named for airlines ( two for american ) . last year , the canadian airlines saddledome , where the calgary flames play , changed its name when its namesake went bankrupt and was bought by air canada . now it is the pengrowth saddledome . copyright ? 2000 dow jones fleeing investors have bid the stock down about 90 % from its high last fall . 4 . a blodget blunder ? speaking of folks who lost money for investors , analyst henry blodget is taking part in a buyout at merrill lynch , reportedly exiting the firm with a severance package of about $ 2 million .

( ap ) - employees of portland general electric are in shock after watching their retirement savings dry up along with the stock of energy giant enron , pge ' s parent company . the sting isn ' t helped by the fact that the selloff coincided with a lockdown that forced employees to hold the stock in their 401 ( k ) retirement plans . stock prices have plummeted more than 70 percent since oct . 16 , when enron announced a $ 618 million third - quarter loss . the loss stemmed largely from investment write - offs that led to the dismissal of the company ' s chief financial officer and now are being investigated by the securities and exchange commission . on oct . 17 , houston - based enron  locked down  the 401 ( k ) accounts , meaning employees were not allowed to sell their enron stock or make any other changes to their plans . the freeze lasted until wednesday . peggy fowler , pge chief executive officer , said the lockdown was the result of a long - planned change in retirement fund managers and acknowledged that  the timing couldn ' t have been worse .  for 2 , 700 pge employees with enron 401 ( k ) plans , the slump has decimated their nest eggs .  we couldn ' t get out , we just sat there and watched our nest eggs go down to nothing ,  said roy rinard , a pge lineman from boring with all of his 401 ( k ) plan in enron stock . rinard , 54 , said his account has dropped in value from more than $ 472 , 000 a year ago to $ 238 , 000 at the time of the freeze to about $ 70 , 000 now .  i just feel like i ' ve been stolen from and lied to ,  said alan kaseweter , 43 , a pge service department employee who had almost all of his 401 ( k ) invested in enron stock . kaseweter , of redlands , said his account has dwindled from $ 348 , 000 a year ago to $ 115 , 500 at the time of the freeze to $ 36 , 000 . enron and pge employees must accept enron stock as the company ' s matching contribution to their 401 ( k ) accounts . only employees over 50 and retirees are allowed to roll it over to another investment . enron seemed like a good bet . the stock climbed 475 percent between 1995 and dec . 31 , 2000 . enron purchased pge in 1997 , while it was reinventing itself into a cutting - edge energy trading company . it took staple products such as natural gas and electricity and attempted to trade them like other commodities . reports surfaced about partnerships founded by enron chief financial officer andrew fastow . the partnerships borrowed money on enron ' s behalf , which allowed enron to keep the debt off its books . fastow left the company , and the u . s . securities and exchange commission opened an investigation . on nov . 8 , enron said it was restating earnings for the past five years , in effect admitting that it had inflated profits . at the same time , enron froze employees ' 401 ( k ) accounts . enron decided in july that it would hire new administrators for the retirement program . the changeover required about a month . enron directors and executives dumped stock through much of the past 12 months , selling more than $ 136 million worth in all - a fact prominently mentioned in recent shareholder lawsuits against the company . investors have also filed five lawsuits against enron ' s executives and directors , including former pge chief executive kenneth l . harrison . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . city - international power looks for purchases . by roland gribben . 11 / 16 / 2001 the daily telegraph p 36 ( c ) telegraph group limited , london , 2001 international power , the electricity generator spun off after last year ' s break - up of national power , yesterday signalled it was limb"

trading companies . investors appeared worried that enron ' s recent woes could have a destabilizing effect on the energy - trading market . the houston energy powerhouse , with annualized revenue topping $ 150 billion and assets of more than $ 60 billion , handles transactions representing roughly one - quarter of the nation ' s traded - electricity and natural - gas volumes . in less than two years of operation , its enrononline trading platform has become a central marketplace for the energy business and already has handled more than $ 880 billion in transactions .  enron makes the market . make no mistake about that ,  said merrill lynch analyst donato eassey .  there ' s not a trader out there that doesn ' t use enrononline .  as such , enron enters into thousands of transactions every day in which the company ' s credit - worthiness is critical . enron said its business operations were functioning normally yesterday . the company also has consistently said it is financially strong and liquid . enron said its new chief financial officer is jeffrey mcmahon , the 40 - year - old head of the company ' s industrial - markets division . his selection may be intended , in part , to raise the company ' s credibility . people familiar with the matter say mr . mcmahon left his job as treasurer last year after voicing concerns within the company about mr . fastow ' s role in running two limited partnerships that were involved in billions of dollars worth of transactions with enron . internal partnership documents indicate mr . fastow and possibly a handful of associates made millions of dollars from the partnerships . mr . fastow severed his ties with those partnerships in july in the face of increasing conflict - of - interest concerns being expressed by wall street analysts and major enron investors . on monday , enron announced that the securities and exchange commission was looking into the fastow - related transactions . while enron as recently as tuesday strongly defended mr . fastow , as well as the company ' s dealings with the partnerships , controversy over those arrangements clearly played a role in the executive ' s departure .  in my continued discussions with the financial community , it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as cfo ,  said chairman and chief executive kenneth lay in a prepared statement . enron said mr . fastow  will be on a leave of absence from the company .  he couldn ' t be reached for comment . it remains to be seen how much mr . fastow ' s removal will assuage an increasingly restive investment community . the action came after the 4 p . m . market close and followed a day in which enron ' s stock once again plunged . as of 4 p . m . in new york stock exchange composite trading , enron shares were at $ 16 . 41 , down $ 3 . 38 , or 17 % . it topped the big board ' s most active list at nearly 76 million shares , more than twice the volume of the second - most - active stock . several trades yesterday involved blocks of 800 , 000 shares or more , possibly indicating that some institutional holders are souring on enron stock . enron ' s shares are down about 50 % from the beginning of last week . earlier this year , the stock was above $ 80 a share . in an apparent ripple effect , the stocks of other energy - trading companies , which do business with enron , also fell sharply yesterday . for instance , dynegy inc . shares on the big board were off $ 5 . 45 , or 13 % , at $ 37 . 26 . a number of the energy companies hit by the selloff have business strategies much different than enron ' s , which rely heavily on complex and highly structured investment vehicles . prudential securities analyst carol coale said mr . fastow ' s departure could be seen as evidence that  management does care  about investor concerns . however , she adds , the move also could be viewed by some investors , coming as it did two days after the announcement of the sec inquiry , as  an admission of guilt .  ms . coale yesterday issued a sell recommendation on enron largely because of uncertainties about the company ' s extremely complex financial structure . enron has consistently denied any wrongdoing in its fastow - related dealings . worries and rumors about enron ' s financial strength could be found in the stock market yesterday . goldman sachs analyst david fleischer said he heard people voice concerns about a possible  death spiral  in which increasing credit concerns about enron would decrease the number of people willing to do business with the company , which would in turn weaken its finances and lead to further business reductions . mr . fleischer , a longtime fan who still has a buy recommendation on the company , said he hasn ' t yet seen any evidence of such a problem . however , mr . fleischer said , enron needs to disclose more information about its myriad of financial transactions with related partnerships and other entities . enron is facing a problem with  trust and credibility . it ' s not easy to regain something as basic as trust ,  he said . copyright ? 2000 dow jones section c enron ousts finance chief as s . e . c . looks at dealings by floyd norris 10 / 25 / 2001 the new york times page 2 , column 5 c . 2001 new york times company the enron corporation , its stock battered by a sudden loss of investor confidence , yesterday ousted its chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow , whose involvement in complicated transactions with enron has drawn the scrutiny of the securities and exchange commission . ' ' in my continued discussions with the financial community , it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as c . f . o . , ' ' kenneth l . lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive , said in a statement announcing the change . only one day before , mr . lay had told investors in a conference call that he and the enron board ' ' continue to have the highest faith and confidence in andy . ' ' the company said that mr . fastow had taken a leave of absence , but it also named his successor , jeffrey mcmahon , the head of enron ' s industrial markets group and a former corporate treasurer . enron said none of the officials were available for interviews last night . the move came after the close of trading on the new york stock exchange , where enron ' s shares fell $ 3 . 38 , to $ 16 . 41 . the price has been cut in half since oct . 16 , when enron reported its third - quarter earnings . a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity brought on by ending some relationships with partnerships that mr . fastow had headed was not disclosed in the earnings news release . mr . lay briefly mentioned it in the conference call that followed , but some analysts thought he was referring to a separate $ 1 billion write - off that was disclosed in the earnings document , and were angered when they later learned about it . on tuesday , when both mr . fastow and mr . lay discussed the company with analysts on the conference call , neither was willing to discuss details of the transactions between enron and the partnerships formerly controlled by mr . fastow . mr . lay cited the s . e . c . inquiry in declining to discuss the details of the transactions . the fact the transactions took place has been known for a year , but enron ' s disclosures have been widely criticized for being impossible to understand . by structuring the deals as involving forward commitments to deliver enron stock , it appears that enron was able to assure that losses on them would not lead to reported losses , but instead to reductions of shareholder equity that had no effect on the income statement . that is one of the issues the s . e . c . , whose inquiries were disclosed monday by the company , is expected to address . concerns have also grown this week over whether enron will face losses from complicated financing strategies that kept billions of dollars of debts off its balance sheet but left the company responsible for paying - - either in cash or with stock - - if things went wrong . on tuesday , mr . fastow assured investors that the company ' ' expects to continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet normal obligations , ' ' and said it had bank credit lines that were more than adequate . mr . fastow was viewed as one of the architects , with jeffrey k . skilling , the former enron chief executive who resigned in august , of the change in business strategy that turned enron from a gas - pipeline company into a an energy trading powerhouse that developed a large wall street following . its stock price peaked in the summer of 2000 at $ 90 . 75 . according to a person close to the company , while mr . mcmahon , mr . fastow ' s successor , was enron ' s treasurer , he told mr . skilling , who at the time was the chief operating officer , that he thought the partnerships involving mr . fastow presented a conflict of interest . after that discussion , mr . mcmahon moved to a different job at the company , this person said . shares of enron traded as low as $ 15 . 51 yesterday afternoon , the lowest price for the stock since early 1995 , before recovering . in after - hours trading , they fell to $ 16 . 14 . one of the factors that hurt the stock yesterday was a decision by m . carol coale , an analyst at prudential securities , to drop her rating to ' ' sell ' ' from ' ' hold . ' ' she had lowered the rating to ' ' hold ' ' from ' ' buy ' ' on monday .

based enron corp . removed its chief financial officer wednesday , as federal securities regulators review business dealings between enron and two investment partnerships that he ran . enron , the world ' s largest energy trader , said chief financial officer andrew fastow had been put on a  leave of absence  for an undetermined period and named another enron executive , jeff mcmahon , as his replacement . the company said the move was not a reflection on fastow or a belief that he had done anything improper .  in my continued discussions with the financial community , it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as cfo ,  enron chairman and ceo ken lay said in a statement after the stock market closed on a day investors continued dumping shares . enron , which had seen its stock battered this year for a variety of reasons , found itself high on wall street ' s hit list after it released third - quarter earnings on oct 16 . the earnings report drew renewed attention to something investors and analysts had already expressed displeasure at : fastow , with the approval of enron ' s board , had formed and run two investment partnerships - - ljm cayman and ljm 2 co - investment . the partnerships , which did complex financing and hedging deals with enron , served as a source of funding for enron projects and investments . but wall street questioned how fastow could watch out for the interests of enron ' s shareholders and the investment partnership at the same time . so fastow , in june , resigned his roles at the partnerships and enron also ended its relationships with the ljm entities . during the third - quarter , enron took a $ 35 million loss related to ending its ljm ties as well as a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity . tuesday , lay told analysts and investors that procedures were rigorously followed to ensure the interests of enron and its shareholders were protected in dealings with the ljm partnerships . he said a  chinese wall  existed between enron and ljm . fastow ' s replacement , mcmahon , previously served as enron ' s treasurer before moving last year to another job with enron . most recently , he headed up the company ' s industrial markets group . a source close to enron said mcmahon asked to be reassigned from the treasurer ' s job because he was uncomfortable with the fastow - ljm setup . enron spokesman mark palmer said neither fastow nor mcmahon was available for comment wednesday . he also didn ' t know whether fastow is still receiving a salary . enron disclosed on monday that federal securities regulators had begun an  informal inquiry  into the ljm dealings . the news proved terrible for a company already working to rebuild investor confidence after a series of failed investments in telecommunications , water and retail power businesses and the surprise resignation of ceo jeff skilling in august for personal reasons . a continuously growing number of shareholder lawsuits against enron followed the earnings report and the news of the sec inquiry . wall street has stepped up its chronic complaints that enron ' s various financial dealings are too complex to follow and that the company fails to give analysts enough data to make proper evaluations . beyond the ljm partnerships , investors are concerned about two other partnerships enron set up . among the worries is that enron will end up having to issue new shares of stock to cover commitments associated with those entities . investors wouldn ' t like that because it would dilute the value of current outstanding shares . they are also afraid that enron ' s debt credit rating may be downgraded , which could have negative impacts on its overall business . in the last six days , enron ' s shares have closed lower and lower . on oct . 16 , the stock closed at $ 33 . 84 . on wednesday it closed at $ 16 . 41 , down $ 3 . 38 . wednesday , the hubbub surrounding enron also dragged down shares in other companies that engage in energy trading , including houston - based dynegy , which closed down $ 5 . 45 at $ 37 . 26 . there is concern enron ' s woes could in some way end up harming the energy trading markets . a conference call lay and senior executives , including fastow , held with analysts tuesday to help clear up questions didn ' t go as enron hoped . on wednesday , carol coale , an analyst with prudential securities in houston , moved from a  hold  to a  sell  rating . front page -

off . that loss , revealed last week , sparked the share sell - off amid concerns there may be more bad news to come . enron disclosed the loss during an october 16 conference call with analysts on its third - quarter results , saying the charge stemmed from closing funding mechanisms that enron had set up in the partnerships established with mr fastow . analysts say the charge has not been satisfactorily explained , leading to confusion among investors and an unofficial inquiry by the securities and exchange commission .  in my continued discussions with the financial community , it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as cfo ,  mr lay said . he said jeff mcmahon , chairman and chief executive of enron ' s industrial markets group , would replace mr fastow . mr mcmahon earlier served as enron ' s treasurer . analysts said it was unclear whether mr fastow ' s departure would be enough . carol coale , of prudential securities , said the move was positive in demonstrating that enron was being sensitive to wall street , which had called for mr fastow to be replaced . yet , she added , it came three days after those calls . ms coale issued a  sell  recommendation on enron earlier yesterday , leading to a drop of almost 18 per cent in its share price .  we are concerned about what we don ' t know ,  ms coale said . she was concerned that enron might have to sell assets below book value to maintain its credit rating , or be forced to issue equity to bolster its balance sheet . enron might also lose customers to competitors that were not under such pressure . enron believes such concerns are misplaced and the sec inquiry will prove the company has done nothing wrong . lex , page 16 .

' ' on a recent conference call ` ` no one thought they did themselves any favor in terms of calming investors ' concerns . ' ' ` ` they were slightly hiding behind the fact that the sec has got this inquiry going . the fact that two days later andy is gone , and he was in the center , is a good sign that the company is realizing just how concerned investors are . ' ' ` ` there ' s always that worry once the sec gets involved that it could extend . you never know what could come of that . ' ' ` ` there is a bit of fear of the unknown about enron now , with the sec inquiry and the risk that there could be further asset write - downs . ' ' ` ` another thing they ' re criticized for is their lack of disclosure . we still haven ' t seen a balance sheet for the third quarter . ' ' ` ` people are saying , why don ' t you include a balance sheet with your results ? they promised better disclosure in the past and that was meant to begin in the third quarter . ' ' ` ` you ' d like to see just more information on asset write - downs and a discussion of their off - balance - sheet financing - - all these vehicles they have like marlin and osprey . ' ' ` ` we ' d like to see some clarity , answering those sort of questions . ' ' ` ` it seems as though enron at least are maybe at the start of a process where they ' re going to address and clean up their balance sheet and they ' ve started to replace management . ' ' ` ` investors have already had enough issues ' ' in corporate bonds recently and ` ` sometimes investors just think , ` not another nasty in my portfolio , ' and i ' d rather exit . ' ' ` ` for certain investors maybe they just get scared . i wanted to know more about it . people had speculated if it could go to junk . i don ' t think they could because i don ' t think enron could exist as a junk company . ' ' ` ` there ' s a certain reluctance ' ' to sell the bonds . ` ` you want to stand back for a moment and look at the fundamentals . ' ' ` ` when the spreads have already moved out that wide you have to reassess and see whether you think it ' s a buying opportunity .

 enron officials hope it will result in increased investor confidence after the energy trading giant ' s stocks have declined in value each day since monday ' s announcement that the sec had inquired about partnerships that did business with enron while they were managed by fastow .  in my continued discussions with the financial community , it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as cfo ,  enron chief executive officer kenneth lay said after markets closed wednesday . fastow will take a leave of absence from the company while jeff mcmahon , who has served as chairman and chief executive of enron ' s industrial markets group , takes over his role .  i think change is good at this particular point in time ,  said fac equities analyst robert christensen said .  i think andy was somewhat beleaguered .  a . g . edwards & sons analyst mike heim , however , said it will take more than replacing fastow as chief financial officer to clear the uncertainty looming in the financial world about enron and its partnerships .  i think the reason why the stock has been declining so sharply the last few days is due to a lack of clarity on the partnership arrangements ,  heim said . replacing fastow alone won ' t clarify those arrangements , he added .  there is still uncertainty despite promises by management to be more transparent to the financial community ,  heim said .  instead of being more transparent there is more confusion than ever .  enron ' s stock continued to plummet wednesday , closing down $ 3 . 38 to $ 16 . 41 per share , a 17 percent decline . since the wall street journal first reported on the partnerships last week , enron ' s stock price has slid nearly 52 percent .  the market was asking for that to happen ,  j . p . morgan analyst anatol feygin said of fastow ' s departure .  this is really the first time enron has acted as an agent of the shareholder in this crisis .  previously , enron ' s managers have been  cautious and defensive in their approach ,  he said . during a conference call tuesday to address investor concern , lay said the partnerships were fully disclosed and contained measures to ensure no conflict existed as fastow carried out the dual roles . the partnerships have since been dissolved . the call didn ' t work for many , including feygin and heim .  i didn ' t hear things like we ' ve unrolled all these partnership dealings or here ' s all the exact details of how the partnerships work or we don ' t ever expect to take any more charges ,  heim said .  what i heard is we don ' t have to disclose that information until the 10 - q is filed .  the turbulent past few months which have included the sec inquiry , third quarter losses and the august resignation of the company ' s chief executive officer , jeff skilling , have left many analysts questioning the company ' s future , heim said .  it ' s really a speculative bet right now , but the odds favor the company being able to weather the storm and being a healthy company if not a year from now , two years from now ,  he said . but much is going to depend on how much enron discloses to its investors , feygin said . feygin said mcmahon worked as enron ' s treasurer for two years under fastow before a disagreement over fastow ' s involvement in the partnerships caused mcmahon to leave his job as treasurer .  internally , jeff was always a proponent of andy not being involved in ( the partnerships ) ,  feygin said .  three days ago i would have said there is no need for a change at the cfo level . today , it was pretty obvious it was something enron needed to do .  copyright ?

BUGTRAQ SUMMARY-------------------1. OpenSSL SSLv2 Malformed Client Key Remote Buffer Overflow VulnerabilityBugTraq ID: 5363Remote: YesDate Published: Jul 30 2002 12:00AMRelevant URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5363Summary:OpenSSL is an open source implementation of the SSL protocol. It is usedby a number of other projects, including but not restricted to Apache,Sendmail, Bind, etc.. It is commonly found on Linux and Unix basedsystems.A buffer overflow vulnerability has been reported in some versions ofOpenSSL.When initiating an OpenSSL session, some information is shared between theclient and the server, including key data. The reported vulnerability liesin the handling of the client key value during the negotiation of theSSLv2 protocol.A malicious client may exploit this vulnerability by transmitting amalformed key to the vulnerable server. Careful exploitation may result inexecution of arbitrary code as the server process, and the attackergaining local access to the vulnerable system. More primitive attacks mayresult in the server process crashing, possibly producing a denial ofservice condition.The consequences of exploitation may vary with the nature of theapplication using OpenSSL.Oracle reports that CorporateTime Outlook Connector is only vulnerableunder Microsoft Windows 98, NT, 2K, and XP.** This vulnerability was originally part of BID 5353, Multiple OpenSSLBuffer Overflow Vulnerabilities. It has now been reissued as a separatevulnerability.2. Abyss Web Server HTTP GET Request Directory Contents Disclosure VulnerabilityBugTraq ID: 5345Remote: YesDate Published: Jul 29 2002 12:00AMRelevant URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5345Summary:Abyss Web Server is a freely available personal web server. It ismaintained by Aprelium Technologies and runs on Microsoft Windowsoperating systems, as well as Linux.A vulnerability has been reported for Abyss Web Server 1.0.3 running on aMicrosoft Windows platform. It is possible for an attacker to make arequest such that the contents of the specified directory are revealed.The vulnerability occurs due to the manner in which excessive '/'characters are handled in web requests. An attacker making a GET requestfollowed by 256 '/' characters will cause Abyss Web Server to return anerror page containing the directory listing of the specified directory.An attacker may be able to use this information to launch further,potentially damaging attacks, against a vulnerable system.3. DotProject User Cookie Authentication Bypass VulnerabilityBugTraq ID: 5347Remote: YesDate Published: Jul 29 2002 12:00AMRelevant URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5347Summary:dotproject is web-based project management software, written in PHP.  Itis designed to run on Unix and Linux variants.dotproject is prone to an issue which may allow remote attackers to bypassauthentication and gain administrative access to the software.This may be accomplished by submitting a maliciously crafted 'user_cookie'value either manually or via manipulation of URI parameters.  For example,the attacker may manually craft a cookie with a 'user_cookie' value of 1and submit it to the project management system.  An attacker may alsosubmit a malicious web request with the 'user_cookie' URI parameter set to1.  In both instances, the attacker will gain administrative access to theproject management system.This problem is due to the software relying on the 'user_cookie' value toauthenticate the user.4. OpenSSL SSLv3 Session ID Buffer Overflow VulnerabilityBugTraq ID: 5362Remote: YesDate Published: Jul 30 2002 12:00AMRelevant URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5362Summary:OpenSSL is an open source implementation of the SSL protocol. It is usedby a number of other projects, including but not restricted to Apache,Sendmail, Bind, etc.. It is commonly found on Linux and Unix basedsystems.A vulnerability has been reported for OpenSSL. The vulnerability affectsSSLv3 session IDs.When initiating contact with SSLv3 servers, clients and servers alikeexchange information. Session information is stored in a session key witha unique session ID.Reportedly when a an oversized SSL version 3 session ID is supplied to aclient from a malicious server, it is possible to overflow a buffer on theremote system. This could result in key memory areas on the vulnerable,remote system being overwritten, including stack frame data.An attacker may be able to take advantage of this vulnerability to executemalicious code on a vulnerable SSLv3 client machine.Oracle reports that CorporateTime Outlook Connector is only vulnerableunder Microsoft Windows 98, NT, 2K, and XP.** This vulnerability was originally part of BID 5353, Multiple OpenSSLBuffer Overflow Vulnerabilities. It has now been reissued as a separatevulnerability.5. phpBB2 Gender Mod Remote SQL Injection VulnerabilityBugTraq ID: 5342Remote: YesDate Published: Jul 29 2002 12:00AMRelevant URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5342Summary:phpBB2 is an open-source web forum application that is written in PHP andbackended by a number of database products. It will run on most Unix andLinux variants, as well as Microsoft Windows operating systems.Gender Mod is a modification for phpBB2 which allows the association of agender with a given user profile. A SQL injection vulnerability has beenreported in this mod.A malicious user may modify the specified value for 'gender' when updatingtheir profile. It is possible to include additional SQL statements in thisstring, and subvert the SQL statement used to update the user profile.It has been reported possible to gain administrative access to the phpBB2site through exploitation of this issue. Other attacks may be possible,including the ability to view sensitive database information or to modifyadditional information stored in the database.6. ShoutBox Form Field HTML Injection VulnerabilityBugTraq ID: 5354Remote: YesDate Published: Jul 29 2002 12:00AMRelevant URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5354Summary:shoutBOX is web-based user feedback software.  It is written in PHP andruns on Unix and Linux variants as well as Microsoft Windows operatingsystems.ShoutBox does not sufficiently sanitize HTML tags from input supplied viaform fields.  In particular, the user website URL field of the feedbackform is not sanitized of HTML tags.Attackers may exploit this lack of input validation to inject arbitraryHTML and script code into pages that are generated by the script.  Thismay result in execution of attacker-supplied code in the web client of auser who visits such a page.  HTML and script code will be executed in thesecurity context of the site hosting the software.This condition may be exploited to hijack web content or potentially stealcookie-based authentication credentials.7. Sympoll File Disclosure VulnerabilityBugTraq ID: 5360Remote: YesDate Published: Jul 30 2002 12:00AMRelevant URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5360Summary:Sympoll is web-based voting booth software.  It is implemented in PHP andwill run on most Unix and Linux variants as well as Microsoft Windowsoperating systems.Sympoll is prone to an issue which may allow remote attackers to disclosethe contents of arbitrary webserver readable files.  This vulnerability isonly present on hosts which are running the vulnerable version of thesoftware and have the PHP 'register_globals' directive enabled.  Thesource of this vulnerability is reported to be insufficient integritychecking of variables.The vendor has stated that this issue is only believed to affect Sympollversion 1.2.Exploitation of this issue on Microsoft Windows operating systems maypotentially expose arbitrary system files since webservers typically runin the SYSTEM context.8. OpenSSL ASN.1 Parsing Error Denial Of Service VulnerabilityBugTraq ID: 5366Remote: YesDate Published: Jul 30 2002 12:00AMRelevant URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5366Summary:OpenSSL is an open source implementation of the SSL protocol.  It is usedby a number of other projects, including but not restricted to Apache,Sendmail, Bind, etc..  It is commonly found on Linux and Unix basedsystems.A remotely exploitable denial of service condition has been reported inthe OpenSSL ASN.1 library.This vulnerability is due to parsing errors and affects SSL, TLS, S/MIME,PKCS#7 and certificate creation routines.  In particular, malformedcertificate encodings could cause a denial of service to server and clientimplementations which depend on OpenSSL.Oracle reports that CorporateTime Outlook Connector is only vulnerableunder Microsoft Windows 98, NT, 2K, and XP.** This vulnerability was originally part of BID 5353, Multiple OpenSSLBuffer Overflow Vulnerabilities. It has now been reissued as a separatevulnerability.9. William Deich Super SysLog Format String VulnerabilityBugTraq ID: 5367Remote: NoDate Published: Jul 31 2002 12:00AMRelevant URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5367Summary:super is an open source set-uid root utility that allows for a similarfunctionality to that of the sudo utility. It is written for use on Linuxand Unix variant operating systems.super is prone to a format string vulnerability. This problem is due toincorrect use of the syslog() function to log error messages. It ispossible to corrupt memory by passing format strings through thevulnerable logging function. This may potentially be exploited tooverwrite arbitrary locations in memory with attacker-specified values.The vulnerability is a result of compiling super with syslog support. Dueto an error in the file, error.c, users that are not in the superconfiguration file will still be able to execute code with rootprivileges.Successful exploitation of this issue may allow the attacker to executearbitrary instructions with root privileges.10. Frederic Tyndiuk Eupload Plain Text Password Storage VulnerabilityBugTraq ID: 5369Remote: YesDate Published: Jul 31 2002 12:00AMRelevant URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5369Summary:Frederic Tyndiuk Eupload is a small script designed to facilitateuploading of files to a remote server. It is written in Perl and shouldwork with Microsoft Windows and Linux and Unix variant operating systems.A problem with Eupload 1.0 may make it possible for remote attackers togain access to sensitive information.Eupload does not cryptographically protect stored passwords. Passwordscontained in the configuration file, password.txt, are stored in plaintext. They may be read by simply viewing the file. The file, password.txt,is stored in a web accessible location and is, itself, accessible forretrieval. Thus it is trivial for an attacker to obtain user passwords andabuse the Eupload service.This problem could allow an attacker to gain access to the passwords toprotected resources.11. Util-linux File Locking Race Condition VulnerabilityBugTraq ID: 5344Remote: NoDate Published: Jul 29 2002 12:00AMRelevant URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5344Summary:The util-linux package is a set of commonly used system utilities such as'chfn' and 'chsh'.  It is included with many Linux distributions.A race condition has been reported in code shared by the util-linuxutilities.  The condition is related to file locking.  Failure to checkfor the existence of a lockfile prior to sensitive operations may, underspecific circumstances, open a window of opportunity for attack.  Theutil-linux utilities often write to sensitive files such as /etc/passwd/.Attackers may exploit the condition to inject arbitrary data into thesefiles to elevate privileges.The reported attacks are complex, time dependent and require specificcircumstances such as system administrator interaction and a large passwdfile.Red Hat Linux is known to ship with util-linux as a core component.Other distributions, those that are derived from Red Hat in particular,may also be vulnerable.It should be noted that the utilities included with the shadow-utilspackage (shipped with SuSE Linux) are not vulnerable.12.

It is usedby a number of other projects, including but not restricted to Apache,Sendmail, Bind, etc.. It is commonly found on Linux and Unix basedsystems.A vulnerability has been reported for OpenSSL 0.9.7 pre-release versions.This vulnerability is present only when Kerberos is enabled for a systemusing SSL version 3.When initiatiating contact between a SSLv3 server, master keys areexchanged between the client and the server. When an oversized master keyis supplied to a SSL version 3 server by a malicious client, it may causea buffer to overflow on the vulnerable system. As a result, stack memoryon the vulnerable server will become corrupted. This could enable theattacker to take control of the SSLv3 server process and cause it toexecute malicious, attacker supplied code.** This vulnerability was originally part of BID 5353, Multiple OpenSSLBuffer Overflow Vulnerabilities. It has now been reissued as a separatevulnerability.13. OpenSSL ASCII Representation Of Integers Buffer Overflow VulnerabilityBugTraq ID: 5364Remote: YesDate Published: Jul 30 2002 12:00AMRelevant URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5364Summary:OpenSSL is an open source implementation of the SSL protocol.  It is usedby a number of other projects, including but not restricted to Apache,Sendmail, Bind, etc..  It is commonly found on Linux and Unix basedsystems.Remotely exploitable buffer overflow conditions have been reported inOpenSSL.  This issue is due to insufficient checking of bounds withregards to ASCII representations of integers on 64 bit platforms.  It ispossible to overflow these buffers on a vulnerable system if overly largevalues are submitted by a malicious attacker.Exploitation of this vulnerability may allow execution of arbitrary codewith the privileges of the vulnerable application, service or client.Oracle reports that CorporateTime Outlook Connector is only vulnerableunder Microsoft Windows 98, NT, 2K, and XP.** This vulnerability was originally part of BID 5353, Multiple OpenSSLBuffer Overflow Vulnerabilities.

OpenSSH Trojan Horse VulnerabilityBugTraq ID: 5374Remote: YesDate Published: Aug 01 2002 12:00AMRelevant URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5374Summary:OpenSSH is a freely available implementation of the SSH client-serverprotocol. It is distributed and maintained by the OpenSSH team.Reportedly, the server hosting openssh, ftp.openbsd.org, was compromisedrecently. It has been reported that the intruder made modifications to thesource code of openssh to include trojan horse code. Downloads of theopenssh source code from ftp.openbsd.org between July 30, 2002 and July31, 2002 likely contain the trojan code.The trojan code appears to be included in the file, bf-test.c. Reports saythat the trojan will run once upon compilation of openssh. The trojanprocess is named 'sh' or the compiling user's default shell. Once executedthe trojan attempts to connect to 203.62.158.32 on port 6667. The trojanwill then wait for one of three commands. A connection to the specifiedaddress is attempted once every hour.'D' will cause the trojan to execute '/bin/sh'. 'M' will cause the trojanto respawn and 'A' will terminate the trojan process. It is highlyprobable that this trojan will give remote root access to vulnerablesystems.The following sites also have been reported to carry the trojaned version of openssh-3.4p1.tar.gz:ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/OpenSSH/ftp://ftp.usa.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/OpenSSH/ftp://ftp1.se.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/OpenSSH/It is not known whether other sites are affected as well.FreeBSD has reported the following MD5 checksum information.

9644,"I got to see Powell talk in March 2001 at the beginning of hisreign at the FCC.  He said they were going to take a realhands off approach, so it's funny that they would blamethe regulators for causing the collapse.  One thing he didget right, is that he wasn't worried that the US was behindEurope in the wireless licensing spectrum.  This is somethingvery prescient in that most of those licensors have had toeat their lunch over the huge licensing costs they paid forvery little benefit.  His legacy was/is supposed to berethinking the FCC's role to stay out of the way in thisperiod of business innovation in the wireless space as hedidn't want the government forcing business models ontothe private sector.His full transcript is here [1].  Interestingly enough Igot to see his speech in person as he was part of the wholeCTIA'2001 Las Vegas keynote series of speakers.  Clay andI hoped a flight out of Ontario to Las Vegas to do demo supportfor Craig Barrett [2].  His message was that there's no differencebetween wired and wireless Internet--it's all the same thing.Instead of scalable networks, we should be thinking about scalablecontent (& using Magi he showed sending a blue man tv commercialfrom a desktop to a laptop to an ipaq to a color smartphone withthe content scaling back for each target platform).The best part of the whole trip wasn't hobnobbing at all,but really the fact that the Venetian had ran out of rooms.They decided to put us up in one of their $10,000/night highroller rooms.  They put Clay in one and me in another.The Venetian is known for having the largest hotel roomsanywhere, but these ones were bigger than my whole house. 8-)Greg[1] http://www.fcc.gov/Speeches/Powell/2001/spmkp101.html[2] http://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/speeches/cb20010320.htmRohit Khare wrote:> I can't believe I actually read a laugh-out-loud funny profile of the > *FCC Commissioner* fer crissakes!

By the > mid-nineteen-nineties, there were a dozen economically viable local > phone companies, a handful of national long-distance companies competing > to offer customers the lowest price and best service, and stores > everywhere selling telephone equipment from many manufacturers├óÔé¼ÔÇØand > millions of Americans had a fax machine and a modem operating over the > telephone lines. A.T. & T. had argued for years that it was a natural > monopoly, requiring protection from economic competition and total > control over its lines. So much for that argument. Over the same period, > the F.C.C. had assisted in the birth of cable television and cell phones > and the Internet. It was the dream of federal-agency success come true: > consumers vastly better served, and the industry much bigger and more > prosperous, too.> > The next big step was supposed to be the Telecommunications Act of 1996, > one of those massive, endlessly lobbied-over pieces of legislation which > most people outside F.C.C. World probably felt it was safe to ignore. > Although the Telecom Act sailed under the rhetorical banner of > modernization and deregulation, its essence was a grand interest-group > bargain, in which the local phone companies, known to headline writers > as baby Bells and to F.C.C. World as arbocks (the pronounced version > of RBOCs, or regional Bell operating companies), would be permitted to > offer long-distance service in exchange for letting the long-distance > companies and smaller new phone companies use their lines to compete for > customers. Consumers would win, because for the first time they would > get the benefits of competition in local service while getting even more > competition than they already had in long distance. But the politics and > economics of the Telecom Act (which was shepherded through Congress by > Vice-President Gore) were just as important. Democrats saw the act as > helping to reposition them as the technology party├óÔé¼ÔÇØthe party that > brought the Internet into every home, created hundreds of thousands of > jobs in new companies, and, not least, set off an investment boom whose > beneficiaries might become the party's new contributor base. Clinton's > slogans about the information superhighway and building a bridge to > the twenty-first century, which, like all Clinton slogans, artfully > sent different messages to different constituencies, were the rhetorical > correlates of the Telecom Act, and Gore's cruise to the Presidency was > supposed to be powered substantially by the act's success.> > The F.C.C. had a crucial role in all this. The arbocks are rich, > aggressive, politically powerful, and generally Republican (though like > all important interest groups they work with both parties), they > immediately filed lawsuits, which wound up tying the hands of their new > competitors in the local phone market for more than three years. Through > rule-making, enforcement, and litigation, the F.C.C., then headed by > Reed Hundt, who was Gore's classmate at St. Albans, was supposed to keep > the arbocks in their cages, so that not only long-distance companies > like A.T. & T. and MCI WorldCom but also a whole category of new > companies, see-lecks (the pronounced version of CLECs, or competitive > local exchange carriers), could emerge. This entailed the regulatory > equivalent of hand-to-hand combat: the see-leck is supposed to have > access to the arbock's switching equipment, the arbock won't give the > seeleck a key to the room where it's kept, so the see-leck asks the > F.C.C. to rule that the arbock has to give it the key.> > Partly because Hundt assured the see-lecks and other new companies that > he would protect them, and partly because of the generally booming > condition of the economy then, investment capital flooded into the > see-lecks├óÔé¼ÔÇØcompanies with names like Winstar, Covad, and Teligent├óÔé¼ÔÇØand > into other telecommunications companies. Even not obviously related > technology companies like Cisco Systems benefitted from the telecom > boom: demand for their products was supposed to come from the see-lecks > and other new players. There would be no conflict between the interests > of the new telecom companies and those of consumers, as one of Hundt's > former lieutenants told me, Reed used to joke that my job was to make > sure that all prices went down and all stocks went up.> > > The years following the passage of the Telecom Act were the peak of the > boom. Wall Street had its blood up, and that meant not just more > startups but also more mergers of existing communications companies: > Time Warner and AOL decided to throw in together, and A.T. & T. and > Comcast, and so on.

Nonetheless, the > chairmanship of the F.C.C. remained one of the best jobs, in terms of > influence and visibility, available to a career government regulator. > Three Republicans emerged as candidates: Powell, who was a commissioner, > Harold Furchtgott-Roth, the farthest-to-the-right commissioner, and > Patrick Wood, the head of the Texas Public Utility Commission and, as > such, a George W.

This meant > that the arbocks didn't want Wood as head of the F.C.C., because he > might be too pro-see-leck. (Wood is now the head of the Federal Energy > Regulatory Commission.) Michael Powell had to signal the arbocks that he > wasn't as threatening as Wood, while also signalling the conservative > movement that he was only negligibly farther to the left than > Furchtgott-Roth.> > Powell did this deftly.

Thus Powell was indicating that if he became > chairman he didn't expect to administer first aid to the see-lecks as > part of the job.

' ' ` ` consulting contracts , donations to non - profit organizations linked to directors , this eats away at independence , ' ' said ann yergen , the council ' s director of research . corporate governance standards established by the new york and nasdaq stock exchanges say all audit committee members should be independent . enron board members , including wakeham and mendelsohn , declined repeated requests for interviews . vance meyer , a company spokesman , said enron could not immediately respond to questions regarding the board . compensation enron ' s board met nine times in 2000 with each member receiving annual compensation of $ 79 , 000 in cash and stock . every member attended at least 75 percent of the meetings , except ronnie chan , chief executive of the hang lung group , a hong kong development business , according to company filings . based on enron proxy statements and other documents , the following relationships existed between enron and board members : - - herbert s . winokur jr . , 57 , is the managing partner of capricorn investors l . p . , a holding company that owns the natco group inc . , a maker of oil and gas production equipment . an enron board member since 1985 , winokur serves on the executive committee , chairs the finance committee and was appointed to a special committee created to look into how enron was managed . in 2000 , natco had $ 370 , 294 in sales to enron subsidiaries , or about 1 . 6 percent of natco ' s total sales . ` compromising ' ` ` we think that anything over 1 percent is compromising , ' ' said yergen of the council of institutional investors . enron said in a proxy statement it believes the terms of the sales were ` ` no less favorable than the terms of similar arrangements with third parties . ' ' - - robert a . belfer , 65 , has been on the board since 1983 and sits on the executive committee . he is enron ' s largest individual shareholder with 8 . 5 million shares , and is chairman and chief executive of belco oil & gas corp . , which operates from an office overlooking new york ' s central park . in 2000 , belco had $ 32 million in trade settlements and $ 1 million in option premiums with enron trade resources corp . , an enron subsidiary . - - john urquhart , 72 , a former general electric co . executive , sat on the board until last may . he received an annual consulting fee from enron of almost $ 200 , 000 a year as a special adviser to the enron chairman . - - mendelsohn , 64 , is a physician who was formerly head of medicine at memorial sloan - kettering cancer center in new york . he pioneered research in controlling cancer through the chemistry of a tumor ' s growth and was on president george w . bush ' s short list to head the national institutes of health . since 1996 , mendelsohn has been president of the md anderson cancer center , part of the university of texas health system . donations mendelsohn joined enron ' s board in 1999 . enron has donated $ 221 , 650 to the cancer center . lay and a foundation he established with his wife , the linda and ken lay family foundation , have donated $ 346 , 250 in the last five years . the enron foundation pledged $ 1 . 5 million for a new clinic . - - charles lemaistre , 77 , headed the andersen cancer center for 18 years until retiring in 1996 . he has been an enron board member for 16 years , is a member of the executive committee and chairs the compensation committee . that panel awarded lay a $ 20 million - a - year severance package that he renounced two weeks ago . - - wendy gramm , 56 , has held positions at the federal trade commission and the u . s . office of management and budget and was chairman of the u . s . commodity futures trading commission . she is director of regulatory studies at the mercatus center of george mason university in fairfax , virginia . she is married to texas republican senator phil gramm . in the last three years , enron and the ken and linda lay family foundation have donated more than $ 50 , 000 to the university and the mercatus center , according to university records . consulting fee - - wakeham , 68 , a charted accountant and self - made millionaire , became a force in the government of former u . k . prime minister margaret thatcher where he was known as her ` ` mr . fix - it . ' ' he was the target of an irish republican army bomb in 1984 that killed his wife and left him buried under rubble for seven hours . enron pays wakeham $ 6 , 000 a month to advise the company on european business . enron ' s audit committee poses particular problems , according to corporate governance experts . the committee is composed of wakeham , mendelsohn , gramm , chan , robert jaedicke , a retired stanford university business school dean , and paulo ferraz pereira , a brazilian banker . wakeham , gramm and mendelsohn are not independent , according to corporate governance experts and standards . ` ` for the audit committee , you don ' t even want the appearance of a conflict , ' ' said charles drott , a forensic accountant who has testified as an expert witness in bankruptcy and business fraud cases involving companies such as delorean motor co . and lincoln savings and loan association . the committee is spread across the globe , with wakeham in london , ferraz in rio de janeiro and chan in hong kong . ` ` the question is why this committee ? ' ' drott asked . ` ` for a big sophisticated company like enron , why did they choose these people ? ' ' swift descent enron ' s rapid decline - - standard & poor ' s corp . slashed its credit rating eight levels this month to junk status - - centered on its dealings with partnerships the company used to move assets and debt off the company ' s books . many investors had complained enron ' s financial reports obscured the partnerships ' businesses to the point they were impossible to understand . enron ' s former chief financial officer andrew fastow led some of the partnerships and earned more than $ 30 million through their dealings with enron , the company disclosed . enron documents filed with the u . s . securities and exchange commission state that the board determined that fastow ' s participation in the partnerships would ` ` not adversely affect the interests of enron . ' ' the documents also say the board approved all transactions involving partnerships that were brought to it by lay and other enron executives . ` ` what went wrong at enron ?

' s indian lenders may take over its $ 3 billion power venture to salvage loans of $ 2 billion if the energy trader files for bankruptcy in the u . s . enron may be forced into the biggest chapter 11 reorganization in history after dynegy inc . walked away from a rescue . rating agencies cut most of enron ' s $ 15 billion of debt to junk status , and its shares are almost worthless . india ' s dabhol power co . , one of enron ' s biggest asian gas and power units , has been mired in accusations of bribery and exorbitant power tariffs . ` ` lenders will have to take control of the project , ' ' said madhav godbole , who headed a panel set up to resolve a payment dispute between dabhol power , enron ' s india unit , and the maharashtra state electricity board , its sole customer . ` ` buyers ( for dabhol ) will have to negotiate with the lenders . ' ' enron , which is owed $ 64 million for bills that are more than 10 months overdue , wants $ 1 billion for its 65 percent stake in dabhol as it exits india . tata power ltd . and bses ltd . , the two bidders for enron ' s stake , have said the price is too high . both supply power to mumbai , india ' s commercial capital . the industrial development bank of india , the country ' s biggest lender , and the state bank of india are among local lenders that loaned $ 1 . 4 billion to dabhol . they have the most at stake if the loans turn bad . the $ 600 million lent by abn amro , bank of america corp . and other overseas banks is covered by government guarantees , while indian bank loans are not . cancellation notice enron on may 19 issued a six - month notice canceling power sales to the electricity board . the deadline lapsed on nov . 19 as the mumbai high court early this month stopped dabhol from serving the final termination notice until dec . 3 . the court ' s move was in response to a suit filed by indian lenders against dabhol to prevent it from canceling the contract . they were concerned the loss - making electricity board will be forced to buy the power plant , making loan recovery difficult . ` ` the matter has become extremely interesting ( for india ) in the context of dynegy pulling out , ' ' idbi chairman p . p . vora told reporters at the lenders ' earnings meet . ` ` i can ' t say more as the matter is in the court . ' ' idbi alone has lent dabhol $ 400 million . indian lenders won ' t attend a dabhol board meeting or a summit of creditors , both of which are to be held in london tomorrow , vora said , without giving any reason . dabhol ' s board is meeting to authorize k . wade cline , managing director , to serve the termination notice . discount ? enron ' s stake in dabhol may now be worth much less than the $ 1 billion it is seeking . still , potential buyers may find it hard to raise the money they will need to finish work on the plant . construction contractors in june stopped work on expansion of the power plant because they hadn ' t been paid since april . the expansion , which was to add 1 , 444 megawatts of capacity to the existing 740 megawatt capacity , and a 5 million - tons - a - year liquefied natural gas receiving terminal , is 95 percent complete . ` ` buyers may get a good price but they need $ 500 million to complete the project , ' ' said pradyumna kaul , an activist who ' s campaigned against dabhol for eight years . ` ` that is a lot of money for a project that ' s in distress and whose credibility is at its lowest ' ' with enron on the verge of collapse . awaiting ` response ' bses managing director r . v . shahi said he ' s waiting for a ` ` response ' ' from the lenders on the future course of action . ` ` they came to us with ( the project ) and our action will depend on what their approach is . ' ' bses hasn ' t set a price it would pay for the project , shahi said . ` ` we ' ve not reached that stage yet . ' ' tata power officials weren ' t available for comment . ` ` the equity value ( of enron ) will go down , helping potential buyers , but that does not solve the basic problem , that of high - cost power , ' ' godbole said . ` ` all parties linked with the project will have to make sacrifices ' ' to reduce the cost of power . dabhol ' s power charges in 2000 rose as high as 7 . 1 rupees , or 15 u . s . cents , a kilowatt - hour , compared with other suppliers ' rates of about 2 . 81 rupees . that led the electricity board to default on bills , and in may it stopped buying power from dabhol , saying it was too expensive . enron was one of the first major companies to enter india after the country ' s economy opened up to foreign investment in 1991 . it was awarded the contract to build the power plant 100 miles south of mumbai without competitive bidding . plant construction was delayed for about two years after public interest groups filed lawsuits against the project , on the grounds its power was too expensive . a state government reworked the contract just five months after scrapping it , a move that sparked accusations of the company bribing politicians in return for the contract - - a charge denied by all parties . enron bankruptcy would be largest chapter 11 filing ( updatel ) 2001 - 11 - 29 08 : 46 ( new york ) enron bankruptcy would be largest chapter 11 filing ( updatel ) ( updating with instinet share price , dividend payment . ) washington , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . may file for bankruptcy protection in the biggest chapter 11 reorganization in history , forcing the largest u . s . energy trader to liquidate billions of dollars in assets to pay creditors . dynegy inc . yesterday abandoned its proposed merger with enron , leaving the houston - based company burdened with debt and the likelihood of insolvency . some analysts said bankruptcy is inevitable and may come as early as today . a bankruptcy filing by enron , which reported more than $ 61 billion in assets , would top texaco inc . ' s record $ 35 . 9 billion case filed in 1987 . under chapter 11 protection , enron officials could continue to control the company while negotiating a recovery plan with creditors . an ` ` automatic stay ' ' under u . s . bankruptcy law would block debt - collection efforts , lawsuits and other actions against the company . ` ` a chapter 11 filing can be a great thing for a cash - starved company being attacked from all sides , ' ' said nancy rapoport , dean of the university of houston law center . an enron bankruptcy would affect thousands of people including the company ' s 21 , 000 employees , its customers , suppliers , investors and other creditors . the court - supervised recovery process would give enron a chance to change strategies and fix mistakes . it might take years to complete and may end in the company ' s liquidation . in addition to its energy trading operation , enron operates a nationwide gas pipeline system spanning 25 , 000 miles . it also owns portland general electric , which generates and distributes power to about 725 , 000 customers in the pacific northwest . the company ' s enron broadband services is building a global fiber - optic communications network . ` witches brew ' chapter 11 reorganization lets companies abandon onerous contracts and unprofitable leases . ` ` every bad business deal enron got into they ' ll walk away from , ' ' said peter chapman , a distressed - debt investor who also publishes newsletters on high - profile bankruptcy reorganizations . the goal in chapter 11 is a recovery plan that allows a company to pay creditors and come out of bankruptcy . a plan typically must be approved by a majority of creditors representing two - thirds of a company ' s debts . then a company would ask a bankruptcy judge for final approval . the recovery plan divides a company ' s value among various classes of creditors . under a hierarchy set by the u . s . bankruptcy code , secured creditors - - those with collateral backing their claims - - are paid ahead of unsecured creditors , such as bondholders and suppliers . financial advisers to creditors and companies in large bankruptcies say a chapter 11 recovery plan for enron would be particularly difficult to produce . ` ` you have a host of intangible assets combined with a morass of contingent liabilities creating a potential witches ' brew of a bankruptcy , ' ' said jeff werbalowsky of houlihan lokey howard & zukin , an investment banking firm that has been contacted for advice by enron bondholders . enron ' s shareholders are likely to lose all of their investment in a chapter 11 case because they would be last in line to get paid . shares , the most active in pre - market trading on instinet , gained 2 cents to 63 cents after plunging 85 percent yesterday . the company ' s 6 . 4 percent notes that mature in 2006 were unchanged at about 22 cents on the dollar , traders said . at that price the notes yield 53 percent . enron said this morning it was evaluating whether it will pay a declared dividend . the company is scheduled to pay a 12 . 5 - cent quarter dividend on dec . 20 ` black hole ' for investors now considering buying enron ' s bonds and other debts , a major issue is the uncertainty surrounding the company ' s value . ` ` until the forensic accountants can get in there and sort things out you just don ' t know what enron ' s worth , ' ' said gary hindes , managing director of deltec asset management llc . ` ` it ' s a black hole . ' ' deltec has no investment in enron , hindes said . enron ' s bond prices reflect the uncertainty . the company ' s 6 . 4 percent bonds , which mature in 2006 , were quoted at 20 cents on the dollar , down from 53 cents tuesday . some recovery for enron creditors in a bankruptcy case may come from lawsuits , said russell a . belinsky , an investment banker with chanin capital partners , which also has been approached for advice by enron bondholders . ` ` there ' s a lot of juicy legal issues , ' ' said belinsky . potential targets include enron ' s accounting firm and its officers and directors , he said . liability dynegy might face some liability for canceling its purchase of enron . dynegy invoked terms of the buyout agreement that gave it the right to purchase an enron natural gas pipeline if the takeover fell apart . dynegy received the right to the pipeline in exchange for a $ 1 . 5 billion investment in enron by chevrontexaco corp . , which owns one - fourth of dynegy . enron might use bankruptcy to prevent dynegy from walking away from the buyout and claiming ownership to the pipeline . the dynegy acquisition , valued at $ 23 billion when it was proposed on nov . 9 , collapsed as bankers failed to raise the $ 1 . 5 billion enron needed to operate until the deal was completed . the lack of funds and a credit downgrade contributed to dynegy ' s decision . bankers led by j . p . morgan chase & co . vice chairman james b . lee tried for two weeks to raise the cash enron needed . investors turned them down because of heightened concern enron wouldn ' t be able to pay its debts . three credit - rating agencies yesterday cut enron ' s credit rating to junk status , triggering an acceleration of the company ' s debt obligations . unraveling enron ' s unraveling began in october after it said shareholders ' equity was reduced by $ 1 . 2 billion because of the way the company accounted for outside partnerships it created . the announcement prompted lawsuits and an investigation by the u . s . securities and exchange commission , and enron ended up restating earnings for almost five years . as shares plunged , enron ' s trading partners lost confidence the company would have the cash to pay bills . trading partners such as mirant corp . either demanded more collateral to trade or restricted trading with the company . ` ` the situation is dire , ' ' said deltec ' s hindes . ` ` no one ' s going to trade with enron right now because you could wind up being an unsecured creditor tomorrow .

of - interest concerns being expressed by wall street analysts and major enron investors . on monday , enron announced that the securities and exchange commission was looking into the fastow - related transactions . while enron as recently as tuesday strongly defended mr . fastow , as well as the company ' s dealings with the partnerships , controversy over those arrangements clearly played a role in the executive ' s departure .  in my continued discussions with the financial community , it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as cfo ,  said chairman and chief executive kenneth lay in a prepared statement . enron said mr . fastow  will be on a leave of absence from the company .  he couldn ' t be reached for comment . it remains to be seen how much mr . fastow ' s removal will assuage an increasingly restive investment community . the action came after the 4 p . m . market close and followed a day in which enron ' s stock once again plunged . as of 4 p . m . in new york stock exchange composite trading , enron shares were at $ 16 . 41 , down $ 3 . 38 , or 17 % . it topped the big board ' s most active list at nearly 76 million shares , more than twice the volume of the second - most - active stock . several trades yesterday involved blocks of 800 , 000 shares or more , possibly indicating that some institutional holders are souring on enron stock . enron ' s shares are down about 50 % from the beginning of last week . earlier this year , the stock was above $ 80 a share . in an apparent ripple effect , the stocks of other energy - trading companies , which do business with enron , also fell sharply yesterday . for instance , dynegy inc . shares on the big board were off $ 5 . 45 , or 13 % , at $ 37 . 26 . a number of the energy companies hit by the selloff have business strategies much different than enron ' s , which rely heavily on complex and highly structured investment vehicles . prudential securities analyst carol coale said mr . fastow ' s departure could be seen as evidence that  management does care  about investor concerns . however , she adds , the move also could be viewed by some investors , coming as it did two days after the announcement of the sec inquiry , as  an admission of guilt .  ms . coale yesterday issued a sell recommendation on enron largely because of uncertainties about the company ' s extremely complex financial structure . enron has consistently denied any wrongdoing in its fastow - related dealings . worries and rumors about enron ' s financial strength could be found in the stock market yesterday . goldman sachs analyst david fleischer said he heard people voice concerns about a possible  death spiral  in which increasing credit concerns about enron would decrease the number of people willing to do business with the company , which would in turn weaken its finances and lead to further business reductions . mr . fleischer , a longtime fan who still has a buy recommendation on the company , said he hasn ' t yet seen any evidence of such a problem . however , mr . fleischer said , enron needs to disclose more information about its myriad of financial transactions with related partnerships and other entities . enron is facing a problem with  trust and credibility . it ' s not easy to regain something as basic as trust ,  he said . copyright ? 2000 dow jones section c enron ousts finance chief as s . e . c . looks at dealings by floyd norris 10 / 25 / 2001 the new york times page 2 , column 5 c . 2001 new york times company the enron corporation , its stock battered by a sudden loss of investor confidence , yesterday ousted its chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow , whose involvement in complicated transactions with enron has drawn the scrutiny of the securities and exchange commission . ' ' in my continued discussions with the financial community , it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as c . f . o . , ' ' kenneth l . lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive , said in a statement announcing the change . only one day before , mr . lay had told investors in a conference call that he and the enron board ' ' continue to have the highest faith and confidence in andy . ' ' the company said that mr . fastow had taken a leave of absence , but it also named his successor , jeffrey mcmahon , the head of enron ' s industrial markets group and a former corporate treasurer . enron said none of the officials were available for interviews last night . the move came after the close of trading on the new york stock exchange , where enron ' s shares fell $ 3 . 38 , to $ 16 . 41 . the price has been cut in half since oct . 16 , when enron reported its third - quarter earnings . a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity brought on by ending some relationships with partnerships that mr . fastow had headed was not disclosed in the earnings news release . mr . lay briefly mentioned it in the conference call that followed , but some analysts thought he was referring to a separate $ 1 billion write - off that was disclosed in the earnings document , and were angered when they later learned about it . on tuesday , when both mr . fastow and mr . lay discussed the company with analysts on the conference call , neither was willing to discuss details of the transactions between enron and the partnerships formerly controlled by mr . fastow . mr . lay cited the s . e . c . inquiry in declining to discuss the details of the transactions . the fact the transactions took place has been known for a year , but enron ' s disclosures have been widely criticized for being impossible to understand . by structuring the deals as involving forward commitments to deliver enron stock , it appears that enron was able to assure that losses on them would not lead to reported losses , but instead to reductions of shareholder equity that had no effect on the income statement . that is one of the issues the s . e . c . , whose inquiries were disclosed monday by the company , is expected to address . concerns have also grown this week over whether enron will face losses from complicated financing strategies that kept billions of dollars of debts off its balance sheet but left the company responsible for paying - - either in cash or with stock - - if things went wrong . on tuesday , mr . fastow assured investors that the company ' ' expects to continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet normal obligations , ' ' and said it had bank credit lines that were more than adequate . mr . fastow was viewed as one of the architects , with jeffrey k . skilling , the former enron chief executive who resigned in august , of the change in business strategy that turned enron from a gas - pipeline company into a an energy trading powerhouse that developed a large wall street following . its stock price peaked in the summer of 2000 at $ 90 . 75 . according to a person close to the company , while mr . mcmahon , mr . fastow ' s successor , was enron ' s treasurer , he told mr . skilling , who at the time was the chief operating officer , that he thought the partnerships involving mr . fastow presented a conflict of interest . after that discussion , mr . mcmahon moved to a different job at the company , this person said . shares of enron traded as low as $ 15 . 51 yesterday afternoon , the lowest price for the stock since early 1995 , before recovering . in after - hours trading , they fell to $ 16 . 14 . one of the factors that hurt the stock yesterday was a decision by m . carol coale , an analyst at prudential securities , to drop her rating to ' ' sell ' ' from ' ' hold . ' ' she had lowered the rating to ' ' hold ' ' from ' ' buy ' ' on monday . ' ' after the s . e . c . inquiry was announced , ' ' she said in an interview yesterday evening , ' ' enron should have addressed it by delivering a scapegoat , as a gesture to the street . now they are replacing him today . the timing is a little late , but i think it will be received positively by the street . ' ' but she said that investor sentiment might work the other way . ' ' people could fear that if you remove fastow from the management team , you ' ll never get any answers .

based enron corp . removed its chief financial officer wednesday , as federal securities regulators review business dealings between enron and two investment partnerships that he ran . enron , the world ' s largest energy trader , said chief financial officer andrew fastow had been put on a  leave of absence  for an undetermined period and named another enron executive , jeff mcmahon , as his replacement . the company said the move was not a reflection on fastow or a belief that he had done anything improper .  in my continued discussions with the financial community , it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as cfo ,  enron chairman and ceo ken lay said in a statement after the stock market closed on a day investors continued dumping shares . enron , which had seen its stock battered this year for a variety of reasons , found itself high on wall street ' s hit list after it released third - quarter earnings on oct 16 . the earnings report drew renewed attention to something investors and analysts had already expressed displeasure at : fastow , with the approval of enron ' s board , had formed and run two investment partnerships - - ljm cayman and ljm 2 co - investment . the partnerships , which did complex financing and hedging deals with enron , served as a source of funding for enron projects and investments . but wall street questioned how fastow could watch out for the interests of enron ' s shareholders and the investment partnership at the same time . so fastow , in june , resigned his roles at the partnerships and enron also ended its relationships with the ljm entities . during the third - quarter , enron took a $ 35 million loss related to ending its ljm ties as well as a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity . tuesday , lay told analysts and investors that procedures were rigorously followed to ensure the interests of enron and its shareholders were protected in dealings with the ljm partnerships . he said a  chinese wall  existed between enron and ljm . fastow ' s replacement , mcmahon , previously served as enron ' s treasurer before moving last year to another job with enron . most recently , he headed up the company ' s industrial markets group . a source close to enron said mcmahon asked to be reassigned from the treasurer ' s job because he was uncomfortable with the fastow - ljm setup . enron spokesman mark palmer said neither fastow nor mcmahon was available for comment wednesday . he also didn ' t know whether fastow is still receiving a salary . enron disclosed on monday that federal securities regulators had begun an  informal inquiry  into the ljm dealings . the news proved terrible for a company already working to rebuild investor confidence after a series of failed investments in telecommunications , water and retail power businesses and the surprise resignation of ceo jeff skilling in august for personal reasons . a continuously growing number of shareholder lawsuits against enron followed the earnings report and the news of the sec inquiry . wall street has stepped up its chronic complaints that enron ' s various financial dealings are too complex to follow and that the company fails to give analysts enough data to make proper evaluations . beyond the ljm partnerships , investors are concerned about two other partnerships enron set up . among the worries is that enron will end up having to issue new shares of stock to cover commitments associated with those entities . investors wouldn ' t like that because it would dilute the value of current outstanding shares . they are also afraid that enron ' s debt credit rating may be downgraded , which could have negative impacts on its overall business . in the last six days , enron ' s shares have closed lower and lower . on oct . 16 , the stock closed at $ 33 . 84 . on wednesday it closed at $ 16 . 41 , down $ 3 . 38 . wednesday , the hubbub surrounding enron also dragged down shares in other companies that engage in energy trading , including houston - based dynegy , which closed down $ 5 . 45 at $ 37 . 26 . there is concern enron ' s woes could in some way end up harming the energy trading markets . a conference call lay and senior executives , including fastow , held with analysts tuesday to help clear up questions didn ' t go as enron hoped . on wednesday , carol coale , an analyst with prudential securities in houston , moved from a  hold  to a  sell  rating . front page -

off . that loss , revealed last week , sparked the share sell - off amid concerns there may be more bad news to come . enron disclosed the loss during an october 16 conference call with analysts on its third - quarter results , saying the charge stemmed from closing funding mechanisms that enron had set up in the partnerships established with mr fastow . analysts say the charge has not been satisfactorily explained , leading to confusion among investors and an unofficial inquiry by the securities and exchange commission .  in my continued discussions with the financial community , it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as cfo ,  mr lay said . he said jeff mcmahon , chairman and chief executive of enron ' s industrial markets group , would replace mr fastow . mr mcmahon earlier served as enron ' s treasurer . analysts said it was unclear whether mr fastow ' s departure would be enough . carol coale , of prudential securities , said the move was positive in demonstrating that enron was being sensitive to wall street , which had called for mr fastow to be replaced . yet , she added , it came three days after those calls . ms coale issued a  sell  recommendation on enron earlier yesterday , leading to a drop of almost 18 per cent in its share price .  we are concerned about what we don ' t know ,  ms coale said . she was concerned that enron might have to sell assets below book value to maintain its credit rating , or be forced to issue equity to bolster its balance sheet . enron might also lose customers to competitors that were not under such pressure . enron believes such concerns are misplaced and the sec inquiry will prove the company has done nothing wrong . lex , page 16 .

' ' on a recent conference call ` ` no one thought they did themselves any favor in terms of calming investors ' concerns . ' ' ` ` they were slightly hiding behind the fact that the sec has got this inquiry going . the fact that two days later andy is gone , and he was in the center , is a good sign that the company is realizing just how concerned investors are . ' ' ` ` there ' s always that worry once the sec gets involved that it could extend . you never know what could come of that . ' ' ` ` there is a bit of fear of the unknown about enron now , with the sec inquiry and the risk that there could be further asset write - downs . ' ' ` ` another thing they ' re criticized for is their lack of disclosure . we still haven ' t seen a balance sheet for the third quarter . ' ' ` ` people are saying , why don ' t you include a balance sheet with your results ? they promised better disclosure in the past and that was meant to begin in the third quarter . ' ' ` ` you ' d like to see just more information on asset write - downs and a discussion of their off - balance - sheet financing - - all these vehicles they have like marlin and osprey . ' ' ` ` we ' d like to see some clarity , answering those sort of questions . ' ' ` ` it seems as though enron at least are maybe at the start of a process where they ' re going to address and clean up their balance sheet and they ' ve started to replace management . ' ' ` ` investors have already had enough issues ' ' in corporate bonds recently and ` ` sometimes investors just think , ` not another nasty in my portfolio , ' and i ' d rather exit . ' ' ` ` for certain investors maybe they just get scared . i wanted to know more about it . people had speculated if it could go to junk . i don ' t think they could because i don ' t think enron could exist as a junk company . ' ' ` ` there ' s a certain reluctance ' ' to sell the bonds . ` ` you want to stand back for a moment and look at the fundamentals . ' ' ` ` when the spreads have already moved out that wide you have to reassess and see whether you think it ' s a buying opportunity .

 enron officials hope it will result in increased investor confidence after the energy trading giant ' s stocks have declined in value each day since monday ' s announcement that the sec had inquired about partnerships that did business with enron while they were managed by fastow .  in my continued discussions with the financial community , it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as cfo ,  enron chief executive officer kenneth lay said after markets closed wednesday . fastow will take a leave of absence from the company while jeff mcmahon , who has served as chairman and chief executive of enron ' s industrial markets group , takes over his role .  i think change is good at this particular point in time ,  said fac equities analyst robert christensen said .  i think andy was somewhat beleaguered .  a . g . edwards & sons analyst mike heim , however , said it will take more than replacing fastow as chief financial officer to clear the uncertainty looming in the financial world about enron and its partnerships .  i think the reason why the stock has been declining so sharply the last few days is due to a lack of clarity on the partnership arrangements ,  heim said . replacing fastow alone won ' t clarify those arrangements , he added .  there is still uncertainty despite promises by management to be more transparent to the financial community ,  heim said .  instead of being more transparent there is more confusion than ever .  enron ' s stock continued to plummet wednesday , closing down $ 3 . 38 to $ 16 . 41 per share , a 17 percent decline . since the wall street journal first reported on the partnerships last week , enron ' s stock price has slid nearly 52 percent .  the market was asking for that to happen ,  j . p . morgan analyst anatol feygin said of fastow ' s departure .  this is really the first time enron has acted as an agent of the shareholder in this crisis .  previously , enron ' s managers have been  cautious and defensive in their approach ,  he said . during a conference call tuesday to address investor concern , lay said the partnerships were fully disclosed and contained measures to ensure no conflict existed as fastow carried out the dual roles . the partnerships have since been dissolved . the call didn ' t work for many , including feygin and heim .  i didn ' t hear things like we ' ve unrolled all these partnership dealings or here ' s all the exact details of how the partnerships work or we don ' t ever expect to take any more charges ,  heim said .  what i heard is we don ' t have to disclose that information until the 10 - q is filed .  the turbulent past few months which have included the sec inquiry , third quarter losses and the august resignation of the company ' s chief executive officer , jeff skilling , have left many analysts questioning the company ' s future , heim said .  it ' s really a speculative bet right now , but the odds favor the company being able to weather the storm and being a healthy company if not a year from now , two years from now ,  he said . but much is going to depend on how much enron discloses to its investors , feygin said . feygin said mcmahon worked as enron ' s treasurer for two years under fastow before a disagreement over fastow ' s involvement in the partnerships caused mcmahon to leave his job as treasurer .  internally , jeff was always a proponent of andy not being involved in ( the partnerships ) ,  feygin said .  three days ago i would have said there is no need for a change at the cfo level . today , it was pretty obvious it was something enron needed to do .  copyright ?

than - expected quarterly earnings reports cheered investors . the dow jones industrial average gained 172 . 92 , or 1 . 9 % , to close at 9377 . 03 after gaining 40 . 89 points friday . the nasdaq composite index rose 36 . 75 , or 2 . 2 % , to 1708 . 06 after climbing 18 . 59 points in the previous session . other major stock indexes gained ground monday . the standard & poor ' s 500 - stock index added 16 . 42 to 1089 . 90 , the new york stock exchange composite index rose 7 . 13 to 561 . 45 , and the russell 2000 index gained 4 . 80 to 430 . 50 . bonds were mixed and the dollar strengthened . the stock market ' s gains were tempered briefly by news that a postal worker in washington , d . c . , was diagnosed with anthrax contracted by inhalation . additionally , two other postal workers in washington have died and their deaths are being investigated to determine if they died of that same ailment . but stocks took the anthrax reports in stride , suggesting a new and surprising level of confidence among market participants , some analysts said monday .  the market is really shrugging off this news ,  said mark donahoe , a managing director at u . s . bancorp piper jaffray . upbeat earnings news from american express , released monday afternoon , seemed to give stocks an additional lift . investors may be shifting their focus away from concerns about anthrax exposure and u . s . military maneuvers in afghanistan to take a closer look at quarterly earnings results , said steven kroll sr . , managing director at monness , crepsi & hardt . the uncertainty on the global front  looks like it is going to be a long , drawn - out affair ,  mr . kroll said .  i think stocks will revert back to being earnings - driven .  although dismal by ordinary standards , last week ' s flood of quarterly earnings reports got a reasonably upbeat reception from investors , who seem to have approached them with extremely low expectations .  the markets acted pretty well last week in light of some very ugly earnings ,  said mr . donahoe of u . s . bancorp . that resilience might be giving hope to investors this week , he added . still , investors will be carefully sifting through quarterly results in the coming week to get a fix on how the fourth quarter is shaping up , mr . kroll argued . third - quarter earnings showed several pockets of strength on monday , with big companies such as minnesota mining and manufacturing and u . s . steel posting results that met or topped analysts ' estimates . the dow industrials got an additional boost shortly after 2 p . m . edt when index component american express reported earnings that , excluding certain items , beat wall street previously lowered estimates . the financial - services concern posted net income of $ 298 million , or 22 cents a share , down 60 % from $ 737 million , or 54 cents a share , a year earlier . excluding charges related to a corporate restructuring and the september 11 attacks , american express said it would have earned $ 595 million , or 45 cents a share , for the latest quarter . analysts had been expecting earnings of 30 cents a share , according to thomson financial / first call . shares of american express surged after the quarterly earnings release , closing up 3 . 4 % at $ 30 . 32 . chip stocks helped lead the nasdaq composite higher , with the philadelphia semiconductor index gaining 5 . 4 % . the rally seemed to be a continuation of friday ' s gains in the sector , sparked by positive earnings news from kla - tencor . u . s . steel , the nation ' s no . 1 steelmaker , said it swung to a third - quarter loss from a profit a year earlier , hurt by oversupply and a weak economy . but excluding charges related to the closure of one mill and damage at another , u . s . steel said its loss was much narrower than what was forecast by analysts surveyed by thomson financial / first call . shares of u . s . steel rose 9 . 7 % to $ 14 . 74 . investors also sent 3 m shares nearly 5 % higher after the maker of chemical and adhesive products squeaked by wall street estimates , despite a 21 % decline in net income . and oil producers conoco and usx - marathon group handily beat analysts ' forecasts . but not all the earnings news was cheery . local phone company sbc communications recorded net income that was slightly below estimates . shares of sbc , a component of the dow industrials , fell 5 . 1 % to $ 41 . 40 . meanwhile , the outlook for corporate profits in the fourth quarter seems discouraging , some analysts noted . on monday , 3 m guided wall stret ' s earnings expectations lower for the upcoming quarter , and a top executive at u . s . steel told analysts that the company ' s fourth quarter would be  difficult .  companies  are meeting third quarter expectations , but they are talking down the fourth quarter ,  said mr . kroll of monness crespi & hardt . he said that some of the rise in monday ' s markets might be a carryover from friday ' s buying activity related to the expiration of u . s . stock option and index option contracts , an event known as  double witching .  one of the hardest - hit stocks on monday was enron , an energy concern that said that the securities and exchange commission was seeking information about certain complex transactions it undertook with a limited partnership organized by its chief financial officer . shares of enron plunged 21 % to $ 20 . 65 . overseas , stocks closed higher . london ' s financial times - stock exchange 100 - share index gained 1 . 1 % , while frankfurt ' s xetra dax index rose 2 % . earlier in the day , japan ' s nikkei 225 average closed with a gain of 0 . 3 % , but hong kong ' s hang seng index ended 0 . 3 % lower . in economic news , the conference board reported that its index of leading indicators for the month fell 0 . 5 % in september , matching the estimates of economists surveyed by thomson global markets . the index - - a composite of measurements aimed at forecasting likely changes in the economy - - included some data gathered after the sept . 11 attacks . the decline , which was the index ' s largest one - month drop since january 1996 , confirmed that the widespread weakness in the u . s . economy is deepening , the conference board said . falling stock prices and rising initial unemployment claims were two of the index components that contributed most negatively to the september reading . in august , the leading - indicators index slipped 0 . 1 % , less than the previous estimate of a 0 . 3 % decline . even so , the back - to - back declines paint a bleak economic picture , said conference board economist ken goldstein . the two - month decline in the index suggests that the already - weak economy is likely to remain weak into next year , mr . goldstein said . the overall reading from these numbers indicates that manufacturing and services are experiencing a significant slowdown . in major u . s . market action : stocks rose . on the big board , where 1 . 09 billion shares were traded , 1 , 813 stocks rose and 1 , 291 fell . on the nasdaq , 1 . 49 billion shares changed hands . bonds were mixed . the 10 - year treasury note rose less than 1 / 16 point monday , or 62 . 5 cents for each $ 1 , 000 invested . the yield , which moves inversely to its price , fell to 4 . 618 % . the 30 - year bond fell 1 / 16 point to yield 5 . 364 % . the dollar rose . the dollar bought 122 . 56 yen , compared with 121 . 20 yen late friday . the euro traded at 89 . 18 u . s . cents , down from 89 . 84 cents late friday . copyright ( c ) 2001 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron faces holder suit from fincl chief pacts 10 / 22 / 2001 dow jones news service ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones dow jones newswires ; 201 -

shares of enron corp . slumped more than 20 percent on monday after it said u . s . regulators are looking into company transactions , another blow to a company whose chief executive resigned in august . a spokesman for north america ' s biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity declined to discuss an inquiry by the u . s . securities exchange commission , but said it was cooperating . the sec also declined to outline details of its inquiry . investor confidence in the company has been rocked by reports from the wall street journal about its relationship with two limited partnerships that were run until recently by enron ' s chief financial officer , andrew fastow . the company also reported last week its first quarterly loss in more than four years , and took $ 1 . 01 billion in charges and writedowns on ill - fated investments . problems at enron surfaced two months ago when ceo jeff skilling resigned after only six months at the helm . enron shares declined $ 5 . 49 , or 21 percent , to $ 20 . 56 in monday afternoon trade on the new york stock exchange , shaving off almost $ 4 . 2 billion of its market capitalization . the stock , the biggest decliner by percentage loss on the nyse , fell as much as 22 . 8 percent on monday , when it opened at its lowest level since september 1998 . shares declined 23 percent last week after the journal ran its first story about the limited partnerships on wednesday . enron declined to comment on whether the sec ' s inquiry into  certain related party transactions  involved the partnerships .  related party transactions  is the heading used by enron in its 1999 and 2000 annual reports to discuss dealings with its limited partnerships , ljm cayman lp and the larger ljm 2 co - investment lp , which engaged in complex hedging transactions involving company assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars . fastow severed his ties to the partnerships in june . ljm was set up in june 1999 for energy - related investments , and ljm 2 in december 1999 for energy - and communication - related investments . the journal reported $ 35 million of its third - quarter loss of $ 638 million were connected with the limited partnerships curt launer , an analyst at credit suisse first boston , said investors should question enron ' s use of real value accounting when the value of certain assets ,  most notably in telecommunications ,  have declined precipitously .  investors have had several opportunities to question enron ' s credibility and at each of those turns the share price has declined ,  launer said . some analysts , though , cautioned against assuming fire when there might only be smoke .  this is an inquiry , not an investigation , and i cannot imagine enron ' s attorneys or accountants would allow it do to something illegal ,  said merrill lynch analyst donato eassey .  it ' s easy for the market to kick a company when its down , but these challenges do not last for a solid company , and we think enron is one .  shares in the company are down 75 percent this year . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron shares plunge 20 percent after acknowledging sec inquiry 10 / 22 / 2001 associated press newswires copyright 2001 . the associated press . all rights reserved . houston ( ap ) - shares of enron corp . plunged more than 20 percent monday after the energy trading giant said the securities and exchange commission had sought information company ' s transactions with limited partnerships , which were managed by an enron senior officer . in a statement , enron said it had provided the regulatory agency with information in response to an inquiry last week .  we welcome this request ,  enron chairman and chief executive officer kenneth l . lay said in a statement monday .  we will cooperate fully with the sec and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest .  investors were upset by the news , however , sending shares of enron down dlrs 5 . 30 to dlrs 20 . 75 in heavy trading on the new york stock exchange . the transactions took place in 1999 and 2000 , according to houston - based enron ' s 2000 annual report . they resulted in a dlrs 16 million pre - tax gain to enron in 1999 and a dlrs 36 million loss in 2000 . enron officials declined to provide details about the transactions or name the limited partnerships , instead referring questions to a section of the annual report on related party transactions .  enron entered into transactions with ( limited partnerships ) to hedge certain merchant investments and other assets ,  according to the section in the annual report . enron spokesman mark palmer said the sec first contacted enron last week and described the request is an  informal inquiry .   this is not an investigation ,  he said .  we see the request as an opportunity to put this issue behind us .  sec spokesman john heine said he could not comment on the filings .  we can ' t confirm or deny that type of activity ,  heine said . the electricity marketer and natural gas provider says both internal and external auditors and attorneys reviewed the related party arrangements , the company ' s board was fully informed of and approved the arrangements , and they were disclosed in the company ' s sec filings . copyright ? 2000 dow jones ag edwards downgrades 10 / 22 / 2001 afx news ( c ) 2001 by afp - extel news ltd new york ( afx ) - shares of enron corp were down sharply in late morning trade , after the securities and exchange commission requested the company to provide information on certain related - party transactions , prompting ag edwards to downgrade the stock to ' hold ' from ' buy ' , dealers said . at 11 . 10 am , enron was down 4 . 29 usd , or 16 . 47 pct , at 21 . 76 . the djia was up 57 . 57 points at 9 , 261 . 68 , and the s & p 500 composite index was up 5 . 57 points at 1 , 079 . 05 . in a statement this morning , enron confirmed that the sec had requested documents , and said it would  cooperate fully  with the commission . however , the company did not give any details of the transactions concerned or of the reasons behind the sec ' s request . according to ag edwards analyst mike heim , enron  significantly reduced  its equity to unroll a partnership arrangement with a partially - owned subsidiary formerly run by enron ' s chief financial officer .  this arrangement , which was not discussed in past sec filings , has led to a growing distrust of the company by the financial community .  in our opinion , the market is most likely overreacting to the news being disseminated over the last few days .  however , we can give no assurances that all the problems at enron have been fully disclosed ,  heim said . in its statement this morning , enron said although its internal and external auditors and attorneys have reviewed the related -

June 4, 1999- Sirs: The following text was located on a site written or placed by you or under your control: DOM is located on Karitane Island and now includes the Taongi Atoll in the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the South Pacific 1000 miles south of Tahiti. However, the Marshall Islands government has condemned the fraudulent assertions of two organizations, namely the DOM and sister nation, the Kingdom of EnenKio (the Marshallese name for Wake Island), claiming to represent the mid-Pacific nation amid an alleged investment scam according to an article in Agence France- Presse. The Marshall Islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of either nation. A Honolulu-based attorney created the Kingdom of EnenKio in the early 1990s. It was based on a power of attorney agreement with Marshall Islands paramount chief Mursel Hermios, which granted the attorney broad powers to act on his behalf. The Marshall Islands High Court has ruled the agreement invalid and ordered it nullified, which the kingdom has disputed. http://www.goldhaven.com/issue4/Two.htm (disconnected as of 2/1/00) The purpose of this letter is lodge a formal request for correction of false and misleading statements made by the author regarding the Kingdom of EnenKio. While I am pleased to find you have apparently taken a serious interest in the Kingdom of EnenKio, I am aghast at how distorted, erroneous and misleading the article is. As a consequence of my service to His Majesty King Remios and the people of EnenKio, I am obligated to respond to incidents such as this. I will respectfully offer the following line by line correction. For your convenience, your text will be set off (with **) in color: **DOM is located on Karitane Island and now includes the Taongi Atoll in the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the South Pacific 1000 miles south of Tahiti.** (Comment: The construction of this statement implies the Marshall Islands are in the South Pacific Ocean 1000 miles south of Tahiti, in which case a reader may be misled.) Correction: DOM is located on Karitane Island in the South Pacific, 1000 miles south of Tahiti, and now includes Taongi Atoll in the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the North Pacific. **However, the Marshall Islands government has condemned the fraudulent assertions of two organizations, ...** (Comment: Just because the RMI government ...has condemned the 'fraudulent assertions' ...of ...EnenKio..., does that make it true? Why would you want to quote anything from a government that has been internationally criticized [and documented] time and again for fraud, abuse of human rights, outright theft and is in default on almost every financial obligation it has ever made? What purpose do you propose to serve by attacking a concerned group of dedicated people fighting for the very lives of Marshallese natives who have been overrun by foreign invaders, bathed in radiation from nuclear fallout and abused by their own corrupt government?) **...namely the DOM and sister nation, the Kingdom of EnenKio (the Marshallese name for Wake Island),...** (Comment: Nothing could be further from the truth. we cannot speak for DOM, but as for the Kingdom, we don't even know what being a sister nation means and for you to make this categorically false statement is not only a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of EnenKio, it is a deceptive intrusion upon the sovereign, His Majesty King Remios, the sovereign of EnenKio and Eneen-Kio Atoll, and an inexplicable and irresponsible abuse of journalism. Doesn't anybody check sources anymore?) Correction: The Kingdom of EnenKio is an independent sovereign state and the same could be said for DOM. **...claiming to represent the mid-Pacific nation amid an alleged investment scam according to an article in Agence France- Presse.** (Comment: The government of the Kingdom of EnenKio represents the people of EnenKio, who are forced to live in exile from Eneen-Kio Atoll, lands and seas that played a significant role in Marshallese culture for perhaps 2000 years. Furthermore, ...an article in Agence France-Presse has no merit as it was authored by a source in the Marshall Islands government. My preceding comments apply. The Kingdom of EnenKio is not now and never has been engaged in an ...investment scam.... We have tried for many years to attract qualified investors and funding sources for programs that will not only benefit the people of EnenKio, but also will positively impact people around the globe. In fact, we are currently working with a former NASA Astronaut. One tool scammers have in their arsenal is to discredit visionary programs of legitimate entities so they can feed on carcasses of the ignorant. Many journalists use the same technique to sell their stories on sensationalism. Doesn't anybody check sources anymore?) **The Marshall Islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of either nation.** (Comment: The Kingdom of EnenKio has made no fraudulent claims of which I am aware, and in my post, I am responsible for all published information. I would personally caution any ..countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of... nations, companies or publications if I had credible proof to that effect. However, my preceding comments apply as to credibility of any RMI ministry source. Furthermore, the RMI has repeatedly attacked the credibility of His Majesty King Hermios, who happens to be the ancestral sovereign owner under Marshallese custom of over 1/3 of the land in the Marshall Islands, including recent attempts to sequester him against his will. We believe some officials in the RMI are afraid of what will happen to them if honesty and integrity returns to the administration of lands and programs to assist the people with their pressing needs and they no longer have their hands on the till. To perpetrate their jaundiced agenda is an irresponsible abuse of journalism.) **A Honolulu-based attorney created the Kingdom of EnenKio in the early 1990s.** (Comment: Mr. Moore is not an Attorney, though he was living in Honolulu in the early 1990s.) Correction: The Kingdom of EnenKio was established by decree of the owner of Eneen-Kio Atoll [a.k.a. Enen-kio, Halcyon, Disclerta, Wake and 6-8 other names], Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios, who then was Paramount Chief of the Northern Ratak atolls [he passed away in December 1998] and was fully recognized by the RMI government. He declared the sovereign state of EnenKio in 1994, whereupon the people chose him as their King over Eneen-Kio Atoll, ratified the Constitution and established government as a limited constitutional monarchy. **It was based on a power of attorney agreement with Marshall Islands paramount chief Mursel (sic) Hermios, which granted the attorney broad powers to act on his behalf.** Correction: The establishment of the Kingdom of EnenKio was made possible by Murjel's appointment of Mr. Robert Moore, the adopted brother of Hermios, Alab of Taongi Atoll and a private citizen, to the post of Minister Plenipotentiary. The document of appointment was also a Special Power of Attorney which granted Mr. Moore very specific instructions to do whatever was possible to expel the United States from Eneen-Kio Atoll and establish an independent state on Hermios' and the people's behalf. **The Marshall Islands High Court has ruled the agreement invalid and ordered it nullified, which the kingdom has disputed.** (Comment: Since when is a Special Power of Attorney an agreement? The Marshall Islands High Court has no record or knowledge of the Special Power of Attorney, except as has been publicized by the Kingdom of EnenKio, and certainly exercises no jurisdiction over Eneen-Kio Atoll, which lies over 100 miles north of lawful RMI boundaries. The RMI has no political or territorial jurisdiction over the islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll because the atoll, by any name you choose, was not incorporated into the RMI when it formed its government in 1979, nor was it subsequently incorporated by any act, law, mandate or otherwise of any present or former Iroijlaplap or Monarch of Eneen-Kio and any statement to the contrary is false, fraudulent and irresponsible.) Finally, I suggest you, as a journalist or publisher, do a little more research, not only into establishment and development of the Kingdom of EnenKio, but into the prehistoric history and more recent U.S. invasion of Eneen-Kio Atoll, properly named by 'Marshallese' centuries before arrival of colonial western powers and missionaries. Then I invite you to our Embassy in Honolulu to review the public files and documents mentioned above, all of which exist in hard copy (not in 'cyberspace') and most of which are referenced or published at our official web site. Be sure to view the documents at our Resource Center which show, in many cases, full-color digitized letters of correspondence with the 59 or so states in the world, many of which are first world. In closing, I would simply appeal to your presumed sense of morality and ethics and request the referenced article be amended or corrected and , if corrected elsewhere, that a link be provided to the relevant paragraph cited above in the article. SKIP TO NEXT FILE ├é TOP OF PAGE June 3, 1999- Sir: The following report was sent to me in which the author mentions the Kingdom of EnenKio (thank you for spelling 'EnenKio' correctly. The purpose of this letter below is to lodge a formal request for correction of false and misleading statements made by the author regarding the Kingdom of EnenKio. Fantasy Island -- Melchizedek passport scam reveals how the Internet can take fraud to new frontiers By Bertil Lintner in Bangkok, December 10, 1998: Determined not to give up, Pedley moved his fictional nation once again, this time to Taongi atoll in the Western Pacific. According to a Melchizedek press release, posted on its home page, Taongi was leased in 1997 under a treaty with representatives of the kingdom of EnenKio, another only-in- cyberspace country, which in this case claims the U.S.-held Wake Island. In real life, Taongi is an uninhabited atoll in the Marshall Islands. http://www.feer.com/Restricted/index_corrections.html (link to article of December 24, 1998: Fantasy Island, disconnected as of 2/1/00) Response to the author: I am unable to locate the Melchizedek press release you cited, indicating that ...Taongi was leased in 1997 under a treaty with representatives of the kingdom of EnenKio,.... Such an act would be impossible and implausible as EnenKio has no legal authority or political jurisdiction over Taongi Atoll in the Marshall Islands. Further more, Melchizedek (DOM) is not so uninformed as to publicly advertise an illegal act in the midst of attempting to find a suitable land base for its people to administer their form of government. The Kingdom of EnenKio did enter into a treaty with DOM on the 19th day of September, 1997, but it did not convey a lease of land. It declared a state of peace and established diplomatic recognition between our governments. However, a prior agreement, signed in May 1997, which had nothing to do with the Kingdom of EnenKio, transferred Mr. Robert Moore's rights to develop Taongi from Mr. Moore to DOM. It did not convey a lease at that time and no such document is in existence. This was made possible because Mr. Moore is the Alab (one class of landowner) of Taongi and had a legal power of attorney pertaining to Taongi Atoll, from the principal landowner, Iroijlaplap (Paramount Chief) Murjel Hermios, who was aware of and supported the transaction. Consideration, if any, under the agreement was personally retained by Mr. Moore, who is also the adopted brother of Hermios. Now, please understand, that while Mr. Moore was acting in the latter case on his own behalf, and that of the future use and development of Taongi, which would have generated an income to Iroijlaplap Hermios, Mr. Moore wears another hat as Minister Plenipotentiary of the Kingdom of EnenKio. Iroijlaplap Hermios, also wore (he died in December 10, 1998, the same date of your article) other hats: one as First Monarch, King of the Kingdom of EnenKio and one as owner in allodium of Eneen-Kio Atoll (a.k.a. Enen-kio, Halcyon, Disclerta, Wake and several other names). For you to state the Kingdom of EnenKio is ...another only-in- cyberspace country..., as you did in the above article, is not only a completely and categorically false statement, but it is a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of EnenKio. And, it is a blatant deceptive intrusion upon His Majesty King Hermios, the sovereign of EnenKio and Eneen-Kio Atoll, and an inexplicable and irresponsible abuse of your journalistic license -- unless, of course, your statement could be proved accurate. I suggest you do a little more research, not only into the establishment and development of the Kingdom of EnenKio, but into the prehistoric history and more recent U.S. invasion of Eneen-Kio Atoll, properly named by 'Marshallese' centuries before arrival of colonial western powers and missionaries. Then I invite you to our Embassy in Honolulu to review the public files, all of which exist in hard copy (not 'cyberspace') and most of which are referenced or published at our official web address: Be sure to view the documents at our Resource Center which show, in many cases, full-color digitized letters of correspondence with the 59 or so states in the world, many of which are first world. In closing, I would simply appeal to your presumed sense of morality and ethics and request the referenced article be amended or corrected and that the link be added to the relevant paragraph cited above in the article. SKIP TO NEXT FILE ├é TOP OF PAGE June 2, 1999- Sir: The following statement (in quotes) was copied from one of your Footnotes to History -D and E (disconnected as of 12/1/00). Enenkio Atoll- In 1898, the United States annexed Wake Island, in the Marshall Islands of the western Pacific. After the Marshalls became a U.S. Trust Territory, the traditional chiefs of the area agitated for recognition that Wake Island was a part of the Marianas chain, and pressed their historical claims to the atoll, called Enenkio locally. The U.S. government has consistently ignored these claims. The protests took a sharper turn after the U.S. Congress in 1993 acknowledged the illegality a hundred years earlier of the establishment by Americans of the Republic of Hawai'i. King Murjel Hermios, who is paramount chief of an archipelago in the northern Marshalls, declared Wake Island's independence in 1987. The Marshalls recognized this claim shortly after the nation gained its independence. In return for his services as Minister Plenipotentiary in the United States, Hermios granted American businessman Robert Moore land on Taongi Atoll in the northern Marshalls, which Moore has declared the Dominion of Melchizedek. Comment: With all candor, I cannot figure how such straight forward facts such as we have presented to the public and over the Internet since 1994 could have possibly been construed into the above referenced text. While I am pleased to find you have apparently taken a very serious interest (unless your site is intended as some twisted joke, which I am assuming is not the case) in the history of the Kingdom of EnenKio, I am aghast at how distorted, erroneous and misleading your summary is. As a consequence of my service to His Majesty King Remios and the people of EnenKio, I will respectfully offer the following line by line correction. For your convenience, your text will be set off (with **) in color: **In 1898, the United States annexed Wake Island, in the Marshall Islands of the western Pacific.** Correction: In 1898, the United States invaded Wake Island, the northernmost atoll -- actually named Eneen-Kio centuries before western explorers arrived -- of the Ratak chain of Marshall Islands in Micronesia and the Central North Pacific Ocean. The Author responds: Rest assured that I did not mean to downplay the role of violence in the American acquisition of the territory. **After the Marshalls became a U.S. Trust Territory, the traditional chiefs of the area agitated for recognition that Wake Island was a part of the Marianas chain, and pressed their historical claims to the atoll, called Enenkio locally.** Correction: Following W.W.II, the Trust Territories of the Pacific, which included the Marshall Islands, was placed under administration of the United States by the United Nations. While Eneen-Kio was well established as one of the Marshalls, the U.S. only knew it as Wake and, having lost many U.S. lives there in 1941 at the hands of Japanese invaders, kept control of it. In 1993, the Paramount Chief of the Ratak atolls pressed his clan's historical and lawful claim to the 3 islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll. The Author responds: I don't see much conflict between the two versions here. **The U.S. government has consistently ignored these claims.** Correction: The U.S. government has consistently ignored claims from the Marshall Islands government, which failed to exert a claim during its move to independence in 1979, and from the former traditional landowners, including Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios. The Author responds: I will note this. **The protests took a sharper turn after the U.S. Congress in 1993 acknowledged the illegality a hundred years earlier of the establishment by Americans of the Republic of Hawai'i.** Correction: The Eneen-Kio claims gained some new momentum after precedents were set by the U.S. Congress, when in 1993 they acknowledged the illegality of the 1893 overthrow of the Monarch of the Kingdom of Hawai'i by a group of American businessmen and U.S. Marines, and in the following year returned the island of Kaho'olawe to the Hawaiian People. **King Murjel Hermios, who is paramount chief of an archipelago in the northern Marshalls, declared Wake Island's independence in 1987.** Correction: King Murjel Hermios, who was Paramount Chief until his death in December 1998, declared the sovereign state of EnenKio in 1994, whereupon the people chose him as their King over Eneen-Kio Atoll, ratified the Constitution and established government as a limited constitutional monarchy. The Author responds: I will make the necessary corrections here. **The Marshalls recognized this claim shortly after the nation gained its independence. In return for his services as Minister Plenipotentiary in the United States, Hermios granted American businessman Robert Moore land on Taongi Atoll in the northern Marshalls, which Moore has declared the Dominion of Melchizedek.** Correction: After the death of the First Monarch, his brother Remios succeeded to the throne as Second Monarch and rules along with his brother, Crown Prince Lobadreo, over the Kingdom of EnenKio today. To continue the commentary: The parts left out were either wrong or have nothing to do with the history of the Kingdom of EnenKio itself. Since HM King Remios also succeeded to Iroijlaplap of the northern Ratak atolls of the Marshall Islands, he also has responsibilities over 10 atolls, 2 islands and over 300 atoll islets. But that is another story, which has nothing directly to do with the Kingdom of EnenKio. I have offered this treatise in hopes that you will find the time to correct your site per my suggestions. Please feel free to contact me or view our pages at the address above. Thank you in advance for your attention and interest in this matter. The Author responds: I imagine that you are asserting here that Moore's Melchizedek project (which can be located on the web through the Sources & Bibliography section of my web page) is non-existent. Be assured I will look further into\par this. Thank you again for your response, Captain Rydell. I should be posting a revised version of the page in the next week or so. (June 7, 1999) SKIP TO NEXT FILE ├é TOP OF PAGE June 1, 1999: News Release Part One Background: On May 21, 1999, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands posted a press release on the Internet at: http://www.yokwe.net/mboard/newsinfo/thread.cgi?67,0\cf0 (discontinued as of 12/1/00). The author, Mr. Joseph Biglar, Undersecretary, is not known to us, has not heretofore communicated with the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, nor with its Monarch, His Majesty King Remios, at any time and has no knowledge of any policies or state activities of EnenKio. There is no valid reason to assume that the said press release is indeed an official document. The Republic of the Marshall Islands has perfect knowledge that representatives of the Kingdom of EnenKio, headed by His Majesty King Remios, on the basis of his proper and lawful authority, have the right and obligation to speak in support of the interests of certain persons, many of whom happen to be Marshallese nationals residing in the Marshall Islands. Response to so-called Press Release: This unprovoked attack upon His Majesty King Remios, Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio, by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands is wholly false. It is also unjustifiably inflammatory and amounts to little more than an unquestionable confirmation of the predilection for infringement upon Marshallese sovereign rights exercised by the current administration of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, which has been confirmed by the U.S. State Department. (See: Human Rights Report) This public posting shall serve as constructive notice to the Marshall Islands Government that any attempt to interfere in the business of His Majesty King Remios, Iroijlaplap of the Northern Ratak atolls of the Marshall Islands, or any acts, decisions, mandates, announcements or directives thereby, shall be met with definitive responses equal to the degrees of contravention. The RMI is unequivocally cognizant that the Kingdom of EnenKio: ├âÔÇÜ├é┬╗ ├âÔÇÜ├é┬╗ exists as a sovereign state as defined by the Montevideo Convention (1933). ├âÔÇÜ├é┬╗ ├âÔÇÜ├é┬╗ was conceived as a separate independent state by its sovereign, Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios, in 1987. ├âÔÇÜ├é┬╗ ├âÔÇÜ├é┬╗ was established by way of a public authority, the Constitution of the Kingdom of EnenKio Atoll, ratified in 1994 by its people. ├âÔÇÜ├é┬╗ ├âÔÇÜ├é┬╗ has negotiated diplomatic and trade treaties with many other states, including the Dominion of Melchizedek ├âÔÇÜ├é┬╗ ├âÔÇÜ├é┬╗ has asserted political and territorial jurisdiction over islands and seas which lie entirely outside and well beyond the area defined as - now quoting Mr. Biglar's statement - RMI geographical and political boundaries. ├âÔÇÜ├é┬╗ ├âÔÇÜ├é┬╗ exercises authorities founded upon prehistoric traditional and matriarchal ancestral rights and titles bestowed, under the sacred heritage of Marshallese customary law (reinforced by the RMI Constitution), upon the acknowledged Iroijlaplaps of the Northern Ratak atolls, whose authority is certainly not subject to scrutiny by Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. ├âÔÇÜ├é┬╗ ├âÔÇÜ├é┬╗ has not subjugated, assigned or encumbered any of its political jurisdiction within its defined territorial boundaries of islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll to the government or people of the Dominion of Melchizedek or to any other entity, including the Republic of the Marshall Islands. Mr. Biglar is unequivocally cognizant that the Republic of the Marshall Islands: ├âÔÇÜ├é┬╗ ├âÔÇÜ├é┬╗ also exists as a sovereign state, defined by the Montevideo Convention (1933). ├âÔÇÜ├é┬╗ ├âÔÇÜ├é┬╗ was conceived as a separate state by (UN) foreign governments, which included the United States, China and the USSR. ├âÔÇÜ├é┬╗ ├âÔÇÜ├é┬╗ was also established under a public authority, the Constitution of the Marshall Islands, ratified in 1979 by its people. ├âÔÇÜ├é┬╗ ├âÔÇÜ├é┬╗ has no relations with EnenKio that allows RMI knowledge of anything that is not also public information and no such public information respecting relations with the Dominion of Melchizedek has ever been disseminated to harm the RMI to be condemned by Mr. Biglar. ├âÔÇÜ├é┬╗ ├âÔÇÜ├é┬╗ has no political or territorial jurisdiction over the islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll, which was not incorporated into the RMI in 1979, nor subsequently incorporated by any act, law or mandate of any present or former Iroijlaplap or Monarch thereof and any statement to the contrary is fraudulent, as in the instant matter. ├âÔÇÜ├é┬╗ ├âÔÇÜ├é┬╗ exercises authorities founded upon the RMI Constitution, which does not incorporate nor authorize political jurisdiction over territorial boundaries that include the islands or seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll and any statement to the contrary is fraudulent, as in the instant matter. ├âÔÇÜ├é┬╗ ├âÔÇÜ├é┬╗ has refused to acknowledge the leadership of the Kingdom of EnenKio in their every attempt to get the RMI government to mitigate the suffering of people residing in the Ratak atolls, under jurisdiction of Iroijlaplap Hermios, and the RMI has rejected every suggestion to coordinate prospective relief efforts through the said Iroijlaplap Hermios. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands is steadfastly advised that any unilateral statements or actions by the administration of the Republic of the Marshall Islands which purport, seek or serve to diminish or question the credibility, existence or authority of the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio in the conduct of its affairs of state, without legitimate authentication by a court of competent jurisdiction, are hereafter to be taken as deliberate acts of aggression upon the Monarch of the Kingdom, His Majesty King Remios, as Head of State, the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio and its people, and will be countered with appropriate responsive measures. Furthermore, in light of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands announcement concerning the Kingdom of EnenKio, your attention is respectfully directed to the following statement in the Preamble of the Constitution of the Marshall Islands, then you decide for yourself: With this Constitution, we affirm our desire and right to live in peace and harmony, subscribing to the principles of democracy, sharing the aspirations of all other peoples for a free and peaceful world, and striving to do all we can to assist in achieving this goal. On behalf of His Majesty King Remios, we, administrators of the Kingdom of EnenKio, have wholeheartedly agreed to pursue the same goal for a free and peaceful world and have made no effort to the contrary.

[Paragraph 4] Thus, it is now possible for an enterprising jurisdiction anywhere in the world to establish itself as an emerging OFC. The newest OFCs, e.g., Niue and the Marshall Islands, are now sprouting in remote areas of the world, such as the Pacific. Even more remote are mere figments of fertile imaginations such as the Dominion of Malchizedek (sic) or The Kingdom of Enenkio Atol (sic), both entirely fraudulent in intent and practice. [note: OFC = Offshore Financial Center] Response: This unprovoked attack upon His Majesty King Remios, Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio, the sovereign state of EnenKio and its noble citizenry by the U.S. Department of State is a reprehensible categorically false challenge of the sovereignty of the Kingdom of EnenKio. It is also unjustifiably inflammatory and amounts to an unqualified felonious defamation of the international reputation of His Majesty King Remios, the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio and organs thereof. The unmitigated audacity and arrogance of the United States to attempt to link the Kingdom of EnenKio with International Crime, narcotics trafficking, money laundering, tax evasion, international drug cartels, terrorists, bank fraud or any other sort of criminal activity, without even one microscopic fragment of substantive evidence to corroborate such deliberately nefarious statements is reprehensible in the least. This public posting shall serve as constructive notice to the United States Government that any attempt to interfere in the business of His Majesty King Remios, Iroijlaplap of the Northern Ratak atolls of the Marshall Islands, or any acts, decisions, mandates, announcements or directives thereby, shall be met with definitive responses equal to the degrees of contravention. Furthermore, this matter will not be resolved until the President of the United States issues a formal apology to His Majesty King Remios, along with the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, and the Congress of the United States initiates a thorough investigation into the abuses of power, subversion of natural rights and illegal occupation by the United States of the islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll. Congressional representatives to Hawaii, the nearest State of the United States to Eneen-Kio Atoll, and those of other states, have repeatedly been advised of the foregoing atrocities and conditions and have failed to respond in kind. The United States is obligated as the self-assured trustee of Pacific Island States in Micronesia to respond to the charges of ethnic cleansing and her responsibility to EnenKio is no less.

14758,"http://newyorker.com/fact/content/?020401fa_FACT1The New YorkerTHE NEXT WORLD ORDERby NICHOLAS LEMANNThe Bush Administration may have a brand-new doctrine of power.Issue of 2002-04-01Posted 2002-03-25When there is a change of command-and not just in government-the new peopleoften persuade themselves that the old people were much worse than anyonesuspected. This feeling seems especially intense in the BushAdministration, perhaps because Bill Clinton has been bracketed by afather-son team. It's easy for people in the Administration to believethat, after an unfortunate eight-year interlude, the Bush family hasresumed its governance-and about time, too.The Bush Administration's sense that the Clinton years were a waste, orworse, is strongest in the realms of foreign policy and military affairs.Republicans tend to regard Democrats as untrustworthy in defense andforeign policy, anyway, in ways that coincide with what people think of asClinton's weak points: an eagerness to please, a lack of discipline.Condoleezza Rice, Bush's national-security adviser, wrote an article inForeign Affairs two years ago in which she contemptuously accused Clintonof an extraordinary neglect of the fiduciary responsibilities of thecommander in chief. Most of the top figures in foreign affairs in thisAdministration also served under the President's father. They took officelast year, after what they regard as eight years of small-time flyswattingby Clinton, thinking that they were picking up where they'd left off.Not long ago, I had lunch with-sorry!-a senior Administrationforeign-policy official, at a restaurant in Washington called the OvalRoom. Early in the lunch, he handed me a twenty-seven- page report, whosecover bore the seal of the Department of Defense, an outline map of theworld, and these words:Defense Strategy for the 1990s:The Regional Defense StrategySecretary of DefenseDick CheneyJanuary 1993One of the difficulties of working at the highest level of government iscommunicating its drama. Actors, professional athletes, and even electedpoliticians train for years, go through a great winnowing, and then performpublicly. People who have titles like Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defenseare just as ambitious and competitive, have worked just as long and hard,and are often playing for even higher stakes-but what they do all day is goto meetings and write memos and prepare briefings. How, possibly, toexplain that some of the documents, including the report that the seniorofficial handed me, which was physically indistinguishable from ahigh-school term paper, represent the government version of playingCarnegie Hall?After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Dick Cheney, then the Secretary ofDefense, set up a shop, as they say, to think about American foreignpolicy after the Cold War, at the grand strategic level. The project, whoseexistence was kept quiet, included people who are now back in the game, ata higher level: among them, Paul Wolfowitz, the Deputy Secretary ofDefense, Lewis Libby, Cheney's chief of staff, and Eric Edelman, a seniorforeign-policy adviser to Cheney-generally speaking, a cohesive group ofconservatives who regard themselves as bigger-thinking, tougher-minded, andintellectually bolder than most other people in Washington. (DonaldRumsfeld, the Secretary of Defense, shares these characteristics, and hasbeen closely associated with Cheney for more than thirty years.) ColinPowell, then the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, mounted acompeting, and presumably more ideologically moderate, effort to reimagineAmerican foreign policy and defense. A date was set-May 21, 1990-on whicheach team would brief Cheney for an hour, Cheney would then brief PresidentBush, after which Bush would make a foreign-policy address unveiling thenew grand strategy.Everybody worked for months on the five-twenty-one brief, with a sensethat the shape of the post-Cold War world was at stake. When Wolfowitz andPowell arrived at Cheney's office on May 21st, Wolfowitz went first, buthis briefing lasted far beyond the allotted hour, and Cheney (a hawk who,perhaps, liked what he was hearing) did not call time on him. Powell didn'tget to present his alternate version of the future of the United States inthe world until a couple of weeks later. Cheney briefed President Bush,using material mostly from Wolfowitz, and Bush prepared his majorforeign-policy address. But he delivered it on August 2, 1990, the day thatIraq invaded Kuwait, so nobody noticed.The team kept working. In 1992, the Times got its hands on a version of thematerial, and published a front-page story saying that the Pentagonenvisioned a future in which the United States could, and should, preventany other nation or alliance from becoming a great power. A few weeks ofcontroversy ensued about the Bush Administration's hawks beingunilateral-controversy that Cheney's people put an end to with denialsand the counter-leak of an edited, softer version of the same material.As it became apparent that Bush was going to lose to Clinton, the Cheneyteam's efforts took on the quality of a parting shot. The report that thesenior official handed me at lunch had been issued only a few days beforeClinton took office. It is a somewhat bland, opaque document-a scrubbed,meaning unclassified, version of something more candid-but it contained theessential ideas of shaping, rather than reacting to, the rest of theworld, and of preventing the rise of other superpowers. Its tone is one ofskepticism about diplomatic partnerships. A more forthright version of thesame ideas can be found in a short book titled From Containment to GlobalLeadership?, which Zalmay Khalilzad, who joined Cheney's team in 1991 andis now special envoy to Afghanistan, published a couple of years into theClinton Administration, when he was out of government. It recommends thatthe United States preclude the rise of another global rival for theindefinite future. Khalilzad writes, It is a vital U.S. interest topreclude such a development-i.e., to be willing to use force if necessaryfor the purpose.When George W. Bush was campaigning for President, he and the people aroundhim didn't seem to be proposing a great doctrinal shift, along the lines ofthe policy of containment of the Soviet Union's sphere of influence whichthe United States maintained during the Cold War. In his first majorforeign-policy speech, delivered in November of 1999, Bush declared that aPresident must be a clear-eyed realist, a formulation that seems toconnote an absence of world-remaking ambition. Realism is exactly theforeign-policy doctrine that Cheney's Pentagon team rejected, partlybecause it posits the impossibility of any one country's ever dominatingworld affairs for any length of time.One gets many reminders in Washington these days of how much the terroristattacks of September 11th have changed official foreign-policy thinking.Any chief executive, of either party, would probably have done what Bushhas done so far-made war on the Taliban and Al Qaeda and enhanced domesticsecurity. It is only now, six months after the attacks, that we are trulyentering the realm of Presidential choice, and all indications are thatBush is going to use September 11th as the occasion to launch a new,aggressive American foreign policy that would represent a broad change indirection rather than a specific war on terrorism. All his rhetoric,especially in the two addresses he has given to joint sessions of Congresssince September 11th, and all the information about his state of mind whichhis aides have leaked, indicate that he sees this as the nation's moment ofdestiny-a perception that the people around him seem to be encouraging,because it enhances Bush's stature and opens the way to more assertivepolicymaking.Inside government, the reason September 11th appears to have been atransformative moment, as the senior official I had lunch with put it, isnot so much that it revealed the existence of a threat of which officialshad previously been unaware as that it drastically reduced the Americanpublic's usual resistance to American military involvement overseas, atleast for a while. The Clinton Administration, beginning with the BlackHawk Down operation in Mogadishu, during its first year, operated on theconviction that Americans were highly averse to casualties, the all-bombingKosovo operation, in Clinton's next-to-last year, was the ideal foreignmilitary adventure. Now that the United States has been attacked, theoptions are much broader. The senior official approvingly mentioned a 1999study of casualty aversion by the Triangle Institute for Security Studies,which argued that the mass public is much less casualty-averse than themilitary or the civilian ├â┬®lite believes, for example, the study showed thatthe public would tolerate thirty thousand deaths in a military operation toprevent Iraq from acquiring weapons of mass destruction. (The Americandeath total in the Vietnam War was about fifty-eight thousand.) September11th presumably reduced casualty aversion even further.Recently, I went to the White House to interview Condoleezza Rice. Rice'sForeign Affairs article from 2000 begins with this declaration: The UnitedStates has found it exceedingly difficult to define its 'national interest'in the absence of Soviet power. I asked her whether that is still thecase. I think the difficulty has passed in defining a role, she saidimmediately. I think September 11th was one of those great earthquakesthat clarify and sharpen. Events are in much sharper relief. Like Bush,she said that opposing terrorism and preventing the accumulation of weaponsof mass destruction in the hands of irresponsible states now define thenational interest. (The latter goal, by the way, is new-in Bush's speech toCongress on September 20th, America's sole grand purpose was endingterrorism.) We talked in her West Wing office, its tall windows face thepart of the White House grounds where television reporters do theirstandups. In her bearing, Rice seemed less crisply military than she doesin public. She looked a little tired, but she was projecting a kind ofmissionary calm, rather than belligerence.In the Foreign Affairs article, Rice came across as a classic realist,putting forth the notions of power politics, great powers, and powerbalances as the proper central concerns of the United States. Now shesounded as if she had moved closer to the one-power idea that Cheney'sPentagon team proposed ten years ago-or, at least, to the idea that theother great powers are now in harmony with the United States, because ofthe terrorist attacks, and can be induced to remain so. Theoretically, therealists would predict that when you have a great power like the UnitedStates it would not be long before you had other great powers rising tochallenge it or trying to balance against it, Rice said. And I think whatyou're seeing is that there's at least a predilection this time to move toproductive and co├â┬Âperative relations with the United States, rather than totry to balance the United States. I actually think that statecraft mattersin how it all comes out. It's not all foreordained.Rice said that she had called together the senior staff people of theNational Security Council and asked them to think seriously about how doyou capitalize on these opportunities to fundamentally change Americandoctrine, and the shape of the world, in the wake of September 11th. Ireally think this period is analogous to 1945 to 1947, she said-that is,the period when the containment doctrine took shape-in that the events soclearly demonstrated that there is a big global threat, and that it's a bigglobal threat to a lot of countries that you would not have normallythought of as being in the coalition. That has started shifting thetectonic plates in international politics. And it's important to try toseize on that and position American interests and institutions and all ofthat before they harden again.The National Security Council is legally required to produce an annualdocument called the National Security Strategy, stating the over-all goalsof American policy-another government report whose importance is great butnot obvious. The Bush Administration did not produce one last year, as theClinton Administration did not in its first year. Rice said that she isworking on the report now.There are two ways to handle this document, she told me. One is to do itin a kind of minimalist way and just get it out. But it's our view that,since this is going to be the first one for the Bush Administration, it'simportant. An awful lot has happened since we started this process, priorto 9/11. I can't give you a certain date when it's going to be out, but Iwould think sometime this spring. And it's important that it be a realstatement of what the Bush Administration sees as the strategic directionthat it's going.It seems clear already that Rice will set forth the hope of a more dominantAmerican role in the world than she might have a couple of years ago. Somequestions that don't appear to be settled yet, but are obviously beingasked, are how much the United States is willing to operate alone inforeign affairs, and how much change it is willing to try to engenderinside other countries-and to what end, and with what means. The leak acouple of weeks ago of a new American nuclear posture, adding offensivecapability against rogue states, departed from decades of officialadherence to a purely defensive position, and was just one indication ofthe scope of the reconsideration that is going on. Is the United States nowin a position to be redrawing regional maps, especially in the Middle East,and replacing governments by force? Nobody thought that the BushAdministration would be thinking in such ambitious terms, but plainly itis, and with the internal debate to the right of where it was only a fewmonths ago.Just before the 2000 election, a Republican foreign-policy figure suggestedto me that a good indication of a Bush Administration's direction inforeign affairs would be who got a higher-ranking job, Paul Wolfowitz orRichard Haass. Haass is another veteran of the first Bush Administration,and an intellectual like Wolfowitz, but much more moderate. In 1997, hepublished a book titled The Reluctant Sheriff, in which he poked a littlefun at Wolfowitz's famous strategy briefing of the early nineties (hecalled it the Pentagon Paper) and disagreed with its idea that the UnitedStates should try to be the world's only great power over the long term.For better or worse, such a goal is beyond our reach, Haass wrote. Itsimply is not doable. Elsewhere in the book, he disagreed with another ofthe Wolfowitz team's main ideas, that of the United States expanding thedemocratic zone of peace: Primacy is not to be confused with hegemony.The United States cannot compel others to become more democratic. Haassargued that the United States is becoming less dominant in the world, notmore, and suggested a revival of what might be called traditionalgreat-power politics.Wolfowitz got a higher-ranking job than Haass: he is Deputy Secretary ofDefense, and Haass is Director of Policy Planning for the State Department-in effect, Colin Powell's big-think guy. Recently, I went to see him in hisoffice at the State Department. On the wall of his waiting room was anarray of photographs of every past director of the policy-planning staff,beginning with George Kennan, the father of the containment doctrine andthe first holder of the office that Haass now occupies.It's another indication of the way things are moving in Washington thatHaass seems to have become more hawkish. I mentioned the title of his book.Using the word 'reluctant' was itself reflective of a period when foreignpolicy seemed secondary, and sacrificing for foreign policy was a hard caseto make, he said. It was written when Bill Clinton was saying, 'It's theeconomy, stupid'-not 'It's the world, stupid.' Two things are verydifferent now. One, the President has a much easier time making the casethat foreign policy matters. Second, at the top of the national-securitycharts is this notion of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism.I asked Haass whether there is a doctrine emerging that is as broad asKennan's containment. I think there is, he said. What you're seeing fromthis Administration is the emergence of a new principle or body ofideas-I'm not sure it constitutes a doctrine-about what you might call thelimits of sovereignty. Sovereignty entails obligations. One is not tomassacre your own people. Another is not to support terrorism in any way.If a government fails to meet these obligations, then it forfeits some ofthe normal advantages of sovereignty, including the right to be left aloneinside your own territory. Other governments, including the United States,gain the right to intervene. In the case of terrorism, this can even leadto a right of preventive, or peremptory, self-defense. You essentially canact in anticipation if you have grounds to think it's a question of when,and not if, you're going to be attacked.Clearly, Haass was thinking of Iraq. I don't think the American publicneeds a lot of persuading about the evil that is Saddam Hussein, he said.Also, I'd fully expect the President and his chief lieutenants to make thecase. Public opinion can be changed. We'd be able to make the case thatthis isn't a discretionary action but one done in self-defense.On the larger issue of the American role in the world, Haass was stillmaintaining some distance from the hawks. He had made a speech not longbefore called Imperial America, but he told me that there is a bigdifference between imperial and imperialist. I just think that we have tobe a little bit careful, he said. Great as our advantages are, there arestill limits. We have to have allies. We can't impose our ideas oneveryone. We don't want to be fighting wars alone, so we need others tojoin us. American leadership, yes, but not American unilateralism. It hasto be multilateral. We can't win the war against terror alone. We can'tsend forces everywhere. It really does have to be a collaborative endeavor.He stopped for a moment. Is there a successor idea to containment? I thinkthere is, he said. It is the idea of integration. The goal of U.S.foreign policy should be to persuade the other major powers to sign on tocertain key ideas as to how the world should operate: opposition toterrorism and weapons of mass destruction, support for free trade,democracy, markets. Integration is about locking them into these policiesand then building institutions that lock them in even more.The first, but by no means the last, obvious manifestation of a newAmerican foreign policy will be the effort to remove Saddam Hussein. Whatthe United States does in an Iraq operation will very likely dwarf what'sbeen done so far in Afghanistan, both in terms of the scale of theoperation itself and in terms of its aftermath.Several weeks ago, Ahmad Chalabi, the head of the Iraqi National Congress,the Iraqi opposition party, came through Washington with an entourage ofhis aides. Chalabi went to the State Department and the White House to ask,evidently successfully, for more American funding. His main public eventwas a panel discussion at the American Enterprise Institute. Chalabi'sleading supporter in town, Richard Perle, the prominent hawk and formerDefense Department official, acted as moderator. Smiling and supremelyconfident, Perle opened the discussion by saying, Evidence is mountingthat the Administration is looking very carefully at strategies for dealingwith Saddam Hussein. The war on terrorism, he said, will not be completeuntil Saddam is successfully dealt with. And that means replacing hisregime. . . . That action will be taken, I have no doubt.Chalabi, who lives in London, is a charming, suave middle-aged man with atwinkle in his eye. He was dressed in a double-breasted pin-striped suitand a striped shirt with a white spread collar. Although he and hissupporters argue that the Iraqi National Congress, with sufficient Americansupport, can defeat Saddam just as the Northern Alliance defeated theTaliban in Afghanistan, this view hasn't won over most people inWashington. It isn't just that Chalabi doesn't look the part of a rebelmilitary leader (He could fight you for the last petit four on the trayover tea at the Savoy, but that's about it, one skeptical former Pentagonofficial told me), or that he isn't in Iraq. It's also that Saddam'smilitary is perhaps ten times the size that the Taliban's was, and has beenquite successful at putting down revolts over the last decade. The UnitedStates left Iraq in 1991 believing that Saddam might soon fall to aninternal rebellion, Chalabi's supporters believe that Saddam is much weakernow, and that even signs that a serious operation was in the offing couldfinish him off. But non-true believers seem to be coming around to the ideathat a military operation against Saddam would mean the deployment ofanywhere from a hundred thousand to three hundred thousand American groundtroops.Kenneth Pollack, a former C.I.A. analyst who was the National SecurityCouncil's staff expert on Iraq during the last years of the ClintonAdministration, recently caused a stir in the foreign-policy world bypublishing an article in Foreign Affairs calling for war against Saddam.This was noteworthy because three years ago Pollack and two co-authorspublished an article, also in Foreign Affairs, arguing that the IraqiNational Congress was incapable of defeating Saddam. Pollack still doesn'tthink Chalabi can do the job. He believes that it would require asubstantial American ground, air, and sea force, closer in size to the onewe used in Kuwait in 1990-91 than to the one we are using now inAfghanistan.Pollack, who is trim, quick, and crisp, is obviously a man who has given abriefing or two in his day. When I went to see him at his office inWashington, with a little encouragement he got out from behind his desk andwalked over to his office wall, where three maps of the Middle East werehanging. The only way to do it is a full-scale invasion, he said, using apen as a pointer. We're talking about two grand corps, two to threehundred thousand people altogether. The population is here, in theTigris-Euphrates valley. He pointed to the area between Baghdad and Basra.Ideally, you'd have the Saudis on board. He pointed to the Prince Sultanairbase, near Riyadh. You could make Kuwait the base, but it's much easierin Saudi. You need to take western Iraq and southern Iraq-pointingagain-because otherwise they'll fire Scuds at Israel and at the Saudi oilfields. You probably want to prevent Iraq from blowing up its own oilfields, so troops have to occupy them. And you need troops to defend theKurds in northern Iraq. Point, point. You go in as hard as you can, asfast as you can. He slapped his hand on the top of his desk. You get theenemy to divide his forces, by threatening him in two places at once. Hishand hit the desk again, hard. Then you crush him. Smack.That would be a reverberating blow. The United States has already removedthe government of one country, Afghanistan, the new government is obviouslyshaky, and American military operations there are not completed. Pakistan,which before September 11th clearly met the new test of nationalunacceptability (it both harbors terrorists and has weapons of massdestruction), will also require long-term attention, since the country isnot wholly under the control of the government, as the murder of DanielPearl demonstrated, and even parts of the government, like the intelligenceservice, may not be entirely under the control of the President. In Iraq,if America invades and brings down Saddam, a new government must beestablished-an enormous long-term task in a country where there is noobvious, plausible new leader. The prospective Iraq operation has drawnstrong objections from the neighboring nations, one of which, Russia, is anuclear superpower. An invasion would have a huge effect on the internalaffairs of all the biggest Middle Eastern nations: Iran, Turkey, SaudiArabia, and even Egypt. Events have forced the Administration to becomedirectly involved in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, as it hadn't wantedto do. So it's really the entire region that is in play, in much the waythat Europe was immediately after the Second World War.In September, Bush rejected Paul Wolfowitz's recommendation of immediatemoves against Iraq. That the President seems to have changed his mind is anindication, in part, of the bureaucratic skill of the Administration'sconservatives. These guys are relentless, one former official, who isclose to the high command at the State Department, told me. Resistance isfutile. The conservatives' other weapon, besides relentlessness, isintellectualism. Colin Powell tends to think case by case, and sinceSeptember 11th the conservatives have outflanked him by producing at leastthe beginning of a coherent, hawkish world view whose acceptancepractically requires invading Iraq. If the United States applies thedoctrines of Cheney's old Pentagon team, shaping and expanding the zoneof democracy, the implications would extend far beyond that one operation.The outside experts on the Middle East who have the most credibility withthe Administration seem to be Bernard Lewis, of Princeton, and Fouad Ajami,of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, both of whomsee the Arab Middle East as a region in need of radical remediation. Lewiswas invited to the White House in December to brief the seniorforeign-policy staff. One point he made is, Look, in that part of theworld, nothing matters more than resolute will and force, the seniorofficial I had lunch with told me-in other words, the United States needn'tproceed gingerly for fear of inflaming the Arab street, as long as it isprepared to be strong. The senior official also recommended as interestingthinkers on the Middle East Charles Hill, of Yale, who in a recent essaydeclared, Every regime of the Arab-Islamic world has proved a failure,and Reuel Marc Gerecht, of the American Enterprise Institute, who publishedan article in The Weekly Standard about the need for a change of regime inIran and Syria. (Those goals, Gerecht told me when we spoke, could beaccomplished through pressure short of an invasion.)Several people I spoke with predicted that most, or even all, of thenations that loudly oppose an invasion of Iraq would privately cheer it on,if they felt certain that this time the Americans were really going tofinish the job. One purpose of Vice-President Cheney's recent diplomatictour of the region was to offer assurances on that matter, while gamelyabsorbing all the public criticism of an Iraq operation. In any event, theAdministration appears to be committed to acting forcefully in advance ofthe world's approval. When I spoke to Condoleezza Rice, she said that theUnited States should assemble coalitions of the willing to support itsactions, rather than feel it has to work within the existing infrastructureof international treaties and organizations. An invasion of Iraq would testthat policy in more ways than one: the Administration would be betting thatit can continue to eliminate Al Qaeda cells in countries that publiclyopposed the Iraq operation.When the Administration submitted its budget earlier this year, it askedfor a forty-eight-billion-dollar increase in defense spending for fiscal2003, which begins in October, 2002. Much of that sum would go to improvemilitary pay and benefits, but ten billion dollars of it is designated asan unspecified contingency fund for further operations in the war onterrorism. That's probably at least the initial funding for an invasion ofIraq.This spring, the Administration will be talking to other countries aboutthe invasion, trying to secure basing and overflight privileges, while Bushbuilds up a rhetorical case for it by giving speeches about theunacceptability of developing weapons of mass destruction. A dramainvolving weapons inspections in Iraq will play itself out over the springand summer, and will end with the United States declaring that the termsthat Saddam offers for the inspections, involving delays and restrictions,are unacceptable. Then, probably in the late summer or early fall, theenormous troop positioning, which will take months, will begin. TheAdministration obviously feels confident that the United States caneffectively parry whatever aggressive actions Saddam takes during the troopbuildup, and hopes that its moves will destabilize Iraq enough to cause theRepublican Guard, the military key to the country, to turn against Saddamand topple him on its own. But the chain of events leading inexorably to afull-scale American invasion, if it hasn't already begun, evidently willbegin soon.Lewis (Scooter) Libby, who was the principal drafter of Cheney'sfuture-of-the-world documents during the first Bush Administration, nowworks in an office in the Old Executive Office Building, overlooking theWest Wing, where he has a second, smaller office. A packet ofpublic-relations material prompted by the recent paperback publication ofhis 1996 novel, The Apprentice, quotes the Times' calling him DickCheney's Dick Cheney, which seems like an apt description: he appearsabsolutely sure of himself, and, whether by coincidence or as a result ofthe influence of his boss, speaks in a tough, confidential, gravellyrumble. Like Condoleezza Rice and Bush himself, he gives the impression ofhaving calmly accepted the idea that the project of war and reconstructionwhich the Administration has now taken on may be a little exhausting forthose charged with carrying it out but is unquestionably right, the onlytruly prudent course.When I went to see Libby, not long ago, I asked him whether, beforeSeptember 11th, American policy toward terrorism should have beendifferent. He went to his desk and got out a large black loose-leaf binder,filled with typewritten sheets interspersed with foldout maps of the MiddleEast. He looked through it for a long minute, formulating his answer.Let us stack it up, he said at last. Somalia, 1993, 1994, the discoveryof the Al Qaeda-related plot in the Philippines, 1993, the World TradeCenter, first bombing, 1993, the attempt to assassinate President Bush,former President Bush, and the lack of response to that, the lack of aserious response to that, 1995, the Riyadh bombing, 1996, the Khobarbombing, 1998, the Kenyan embassy bombing and the Tanzanian embassybombing, 1999, the plot to launch millennium attacks, 2000, the bombing ofthe Cole. Throughout this period, infractions on inspections by the Iraqis,and eventually the withdrawal of the entire inspection regime, and thefailure to respond significantly to Iraqi incursions in the Kurdish areas.No one would say these challenges posed easy problems, but if you take thatlong list and you ask, 'Did we respond in a way which discouraged peoplefrom supporting terrorist activities, or activities clearly against ourinterests? Did we help to shape the environment in a way which discouragedfurther aggressions against U.S. interests?,' many observers conclude no,and ask whether it was then easier for someone like Osama bin Laden to riseup and say credibly, 'The Americans don't have the stomach to defendthemselves. They won't take casualties to defend their interests. They aremorally weak.' Libby insisted that the American response to September 11th has not beenstandard or foreordained. Look at what the President has done inAfghanistan, he said, and look at his speech to the joint session ofCongress-meaning the State of the Union Message, in January. He made itclear that it's an important area. He made it clear that we believe inexpanding the zone of democracy even in this difficult part of the world.He made it clear that we stand by our friends and defend our interests. Andhe had the courage to identify those states which present a problem, and tobegin to build consensus for action that would need to be taken if there isnot a change of behavior on their part. Take the Afghan case, for example.There are many other courses that the President could have taken. He couldhave waited for juridical proof before we responded. He could have engagedin long negotiations with the Taliban. He could have failed to seek a newrelationship with Pakistan, based on its past nuclear tests, or been soafraid of weakening Pakistan that we didn't seek its help. This list couldgo on to twice or three times the length I've mentioned so far. But,instead, the President saw an opportunity to refashion relations whilestanding up for our interests. The problem is complex, and we don't knowyet how it will end, but"
